    Hi there!

    I am reaching out to make you aware of an opportunity you may be interested
    in. Before I dive in with the details, I completely understand if itâ€™s not
    the right time for you to hear about opportunities at Facebook, especially
    given the uncertainty around the current situation and how it may be
    impacting all of us and the people we care about.

    However, in case this is of interest, I wanted to open the line of
    communication and inform you that Facebook is running an **UK &amp; Ireland
    Virtual Hack on the 22nd August** for students interested in Software,
    Front-End, Production and Network Engineering.

    During this event you can work through a series of challenges and workshops,
    competing in teams of up to 5 people. We'll supply the fun diversions,
    prizes, and some expert guidance in the form of our engineers.

    This event is open to students studying in the UK and Ireland.

    **You MUST be an enrolled university student to attend this event**

    If you are interested in attending, please apply with your CV by following
    this link:

    **Applications close on July 20th @ 10:00 GMT.**

    Best wishes,
