    We're saying goodbye to another busy week full of events both on- and off-campus. We hope that
    you found our sponsored industrial events by DRW and LSEG helpful and we hope you enjoyed our
    informative Internship 101 session. Also, a big thank you those who went to the AMEX pub quiz
    and the LSEG WIN afternoon session.

    For next week we have more educational events planned, as well as a Game Jam, but also a lot of
    messages for you! So without further ado, let's get right into it.

  <heading>CGCU Football League</heading>
  <image src="https://i.imgur.com/DPERyrD.jpg"/>
  <text>
    For those who don't know, the CGCU Football League is a currently running championship, where
    each department represented in the CGCU competes to prove their superiority in the game of
    football.

    To represent DoC, we have team Foo Bar FC with players:
    Athithan Dharmaratnam, Avish
    Vijayaraghavan, George Mitenkov, Kyle Patel, Rohan Gupta, Pranav Bansal. In their first match
    against the Chem Eng Blues, our team won with a whopping 4-1. Here's a brief match report from
    the game:

    First game of the season produced a strong start for league aspirations with a dominating win
    against the Chem Eng Blues. A solid defensive performance by Rohan and Pranav created a
    foundation for the attackers to play more freely. The final goal summed up the performance of
    Foo Bar FC with a route one goal kick to Avish, banged in with a first time volley. A clinical
    all round performance.

    We wish the players even more success in the games to come and to make DoC proud of their
    performance.

    Sign up [here](https://icmathscomp.org/signup/). You can have a look at [past papers
    here](https://icmathscomp.org/pages/past-papers.html).

    Students from all departments are welcomed, both undergraduate and one-year master's. Some of the
    problems on the papers may require knowledge from the first year of an undergraduate course in
    Maths, much of which is covered in science and engineering courses as well. A separate team
    competition will be run in Term 2, with details to be announced in January.

      **Please note this event has been rescheduled to the 19th of November. We apologize for the
      inconvenience.**

      Come and join us at our bi-weekly Reading Groups. This time we have Sophia Drossopoulou who
      will talk about her research "Holistic specifications for robust code". This talk is aimed at
      penultimate/4th year undergraduate as well as postgraduate students.

      Abstract
      Functional specifications of program components describe what the code can do ‚Äî the sufficient
      conditions to invoke the component‚Äôs operations: a client who supplies arguments meeting that
      operation‚Äôs preconditions can invoke it, and obtain the associated effect. While
      specifications of sufficient conditions may be enough to reason about complete, unchanging
      programs, they cannot support reasoning about components that interact with external
      components of possibly unknown provenance. In this open world setting, ensuring that your
      component is robust even when executing with buggy or malicious external code is critical.
      Holistic specifications ‚Äî as their name implies ‚Äî are concerned with the overall behaviour of
      a component, in all possible interleavings of calls to the component‚Äôs operations with those
      of the external code. Thus, holistic specifications are concerned with sufficient conditions,
      i.e. what is enough to cause some effect, as well as with necessary conditions, i.e. what are
      the conditions without which an effect will not happen. By adopting holistic specification
      techniques, programmers can explicitly define what their components should not do, making it
      easier to write robust and reliable programs.

      In this work we argue for the need for such holistic specifications, propose a language
      Chainmail for writing specifications, give a formal semantics, and discuss several examples
      from the literature.

      Traders in financial markets perform tasks that require them to absorb large amounts of data
      in limited time and make rapid decisions. Time is money and sub-optimal performance can cost
      firms hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Liquidnet augments the human expert with a
      variety of technologies, from anomaly detection pattern recognition algorithms to natural
      language generation and visualizations.

      **Join Liquidnet Chief Data Scientist Tom Doris, PhD.** to discuss challenges in adoption and
      adherence of new technologies by human experts, deconstruct the methods that were effective in
      overcoming the obstacles, and review similarities across other industries.

      There will be an opportunity to network with members of Tom's Technology team, our Recruitment
      Team and Product Team once the interactive session has ended.

      Refreshments will be served.
