    Hi everyone!

    We're very pleaseed to announce this summer's DoCSoc merch drop!

    This year, we're bringing you hoodies, t-shirts, and (much requested) cargo trousers. Plus, another item or two.

    Due to the wide range of sizes for cargo trousers, we will be doing a pre-order for them. This means you'll pay for them now, we'll order them soon, and then you'll collect them with the rest of the merch drop near the end of term.

    Pre-order your subsidised merch [here](https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/shop/csp/computing/docsoc-cargo-trousers-preorder) before 13/05/25! Limited quantities available.

    Keep your eyes peeled for the full merch drop in a few weeks, once we've received the final products!
