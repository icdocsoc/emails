    Hi there!

    On Saturday 8th June we're running the NEW edition of the Facebook London
    Hack - a daylong event of fun challenges to test your skills.

    Join Facebook at the London HQ, as we work through a series of challenges,
    learning and having some fun! competing in teams of up to 5 people. We'll
    supply the food, fun diversions, prizes, and some expert guidance in the
    form of our engineers.

    This event is open to students studying in the UK and select nearby countries.
    If you are traveling from outside London, we will provide reimbursement for public transportation.

    *You MUST be an enrolled university student to attend this event.*

    If you are interested in attending, please apply with your CV by following
