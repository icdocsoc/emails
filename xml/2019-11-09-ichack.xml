    Our annual hackathon is coming up and we're looking for volunteers! Last year, IC Hack 19 was
    the largest student run hackathon in the UK with over 420 attendees. This year, we aim to make
    it bigger and better! Check out our
    [montage from IC Hack 19!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy6tcQY6K6Q).

    Our kickoff meeting will take place on **Monday 11th 6-8pm in Huxley 145** and
    we're looking for people to take on the responsibilities beyond the standard volunteering role.
    If you want to be a part of this mammoth event, come along to find out more about the roles
    we're looking for!
