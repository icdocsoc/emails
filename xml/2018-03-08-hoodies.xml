    The long-awaited hoodies, T-shirts and beanies have finally arrived!

    If you've ordered one of the above, Jack will be in labs **today** and
    **Friday** from 14.00 onwards with all the merchandise so feel free to come
    collect yours then.

    If you can't make it today or Friday, don't worry as they'll be available
    to collect next week as well. If even this doesn't work, send us an email
