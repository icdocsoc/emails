    Women in Computing are really pleased to announce that we are launching
    **Women in Computing Entrepreneurs (WiCE)**, a scheme within DoC with the
    intent of promoting, supporting and encouraging female entrepreneurship by
    providing information, regular talks and mentorships to both students and
    staff who are curious about setting up their own business. To find out
    more, check out the [WiCE website](http://wic.doc.ic.ac.uk/wice).

    Read on for details on our inaugural WiCE event: **The Hesitant
    Entrepreneur**!

    Becoming your own boss does not fit your personality or lifestyle? The data
    shows that this choice is largely influenced by society and less of a
    personal choice.

    Join Women in Computing for a talk where we will explore not only the
    biases that society holds that prevent women entrepreneurs to grow, but
    more importantly what prevents women from starting their own businesses in
    the first place. Throughout this talk, you might discover there is in fact
    an entrepreneur within you, and how you can become empowered to challenge
    the existing norm and create your own business.

    This talk will be given by Dr Maria Vigliotti, a former academic at the
    Department of Computing at Imperial College London. Maria has worked with
    several start-ups, and now runs Sandblocks Consulting, a boutique
    consultancy specialising in blockchain technology and cybersecurity.

    Make sure to [**register on
    Eventbrite**](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-hesitant-entrepreneur-tickets-151089026345)
    and submit any questions for Maria in advance to [this Google
    form](https://forms.gle/B3zVFePPBSsCzNZ39). Hope to see you there!
