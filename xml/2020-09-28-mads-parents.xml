    Dear all DoCSoc Mums and Dads,

    Just to let you know, we’ve started to allocate all families with
    children and the DoCSoc MaD event takes place very soon. So
    please start contacting the children you’ve been allocated so
    far and start making some group chats to help support them as
    they begin their transition to university.

    Please remember that we might reallocate your children if you do
    not engage with them.

    Kind regards,

    DoCSoc
