    Do you want to learn how to write the fastest and best performing code
    possible? Are you ready to dive into assembly, cache internals and squeeze
    the last nanosecond out of your code? If so, then join our low-latency
    workshop on code optimisation!

    During this workshop one of our engineers will demonstrate some of the
    profiling and micro-benchmarking techniques used when developing
    low-latency code. Through concrete code examples, we will share some of the
    performance tips and tricks attained from our vast experience in writing
    fast, maintainable and modern C++ code. We will look into assembly
    generated by the compiler to understand how seemingly small code changes
    affect the work a processor needs to do.

    Whether you write games, mobile applications or trading software, these
    techniques will help you to write faster and more efficient code!

    _Please note this webinar is suited for students with at least some
    pre-existing C++ knowledge_

    When: 20th of October at 6pm (UK time)
