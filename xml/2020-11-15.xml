      Are you new to Golang?

      Learn how to use Golang w/ Next Jump and have a chat with our team
      afterwards!

      As a company, we were an early adopter of Go and have stuck with it ever
      since. So we’d like to show you why we love using it so much and give you
      an intro into how you can use it too!

      We’d love to bring some of that Golang fun to Imperial DocSoc. It will be
      an awesome evening for Go coding and a chance to get to know us!

      Make the most of it by downloading Go beforehand from
      https://golang.org/.  You can then code along during the event.

      We’re really excited to meet all of you, so we hope to see you there!

      Quantum computing is the hot topic everyone is talking about. The Physics
      Society, in partnership with the Department of Computing Society, is
      launching a new series of lectures on quantum computing for
      undergraduates. The first lecture will be on Wednesday, November 18th at
      15:00 UK time and will be delivered by the world-renowned researcher
      Prof. Myunghsik Kim and it will consist of an overview of the field and

  <heading>Arrival</heading>
  <sponsor company="arrival">

    Arrival is accelerating autonomous and electric vehicle technology, by
    fusing AI with new forms of automotive engineering. Arrival recently placed
    1st in LinkedIn's Hottest UK Startups of 2020, is one of the world's newest
    Unicorn's and has won numerous design awards for its new standard of
    zero-emission vehicles and technology products.

    ![Arrival van and bus](https://i.imgur.com/Ee9oaYo.png)

    Arrival is reinventing the automotive industry with its entirely new
    approach to the design and assembly of electric vehicles. The company’s new
    method uses low CapEx, rapidly scalable Microfactories that can be placed
    anywhere in the world to serve the regions they are located in. These
    Microfactories, combined with proprietary in-house developed components,
    materials and software, enable the production of best in class vehicles
    that are competitively priced to fossil fuel variants. This transformative
    approach reduces the costs of production and emissions of shipping, and
    does not require massive upfront investment, creating strong unit economics
    for the whole of Arrival’s product portfolio, including its electric van
    and bus announced earlier this year.
