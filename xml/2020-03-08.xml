        Hi everyone,

        Last week we hosted our annual event Revel with a massive success and we
        hope you all enjoyed yourselves! As we're getting closer to the end of
        term we are reflecting back on the many great events we had this year
        and certainly these past few months were full a lot of fun and
        organisation. On this note, IC Hack 20 photos are now out and for
        everybody who seeks
        a bit of nostalgia, here's the link:

        That being said, next week will be quieter as third and fourth years
        begin their revision weeks and Leadership Election voting opens.
        However, we will be celebrating International Women's Day and Women's
        History Month with two very interesting panels on Tuesday and Wednesday.
        Also, we are announcing DoCSoc merch, which is now available for
        purchase on the Union Store!

        Let's get right into the digest for more information!

        <text>
            With the modern world obsessed with the pursuit of productivity many
            students of our generation are left little time before they graduate
            to ask themselvesâ€¦ what makes meaningful work?

            This is one of the greatest debates of the modern workforce.

            At the end of the student chapter, for some even since the
            beginning, many graduates are pressured into entering industries
            that do not reside within their interests but rather for their
            security and welfare on the job market.

            Here at the Hack for Humanity Initiative (H4Hi) we believe that
            meaningful work and ultimately, satisfaction stems from the success
            in creating a positive impact on society that we live in.

            However, each industry has an impact on the society we live in. From
            finance to engineering, to NGO's the type of impact each industry
            and sector produces is unique and the greatest impact within sectors
            is mostly unpronounced and unknown to those that are not in that
            industry.

            The event we are hosting is an evening talk with leading
            professionals from various industries on how their industry is
            creating a positive impact on society and how they got there.

    <heading>WiTT at Jane Street</heading>
    <sponsor company="jane_street">
        \
        **We are excited to host our sixth year of WiTT at Jane Street!
        Will you be there?**

        Women in Trading and Technology (WiTT) is a three-day programme designed
        for women in their
        penultimate year of university as of autumn 2020. Participants will have
        an exclusive
        opportunity to explore careers within our firm and attend one of two
        educational programmes:
        quantitative trading and software engineering.

        Both programmes feature interactive classes and activities during the
        day, and evening social
        events to speak with Jane Street employees and other women attending the
        event in a more casual
        setting.

        The quantitative trading programme focuses on mathematical and financial
        topicsâ€”such as
        probability, market structure, and arbitrageâ€”through a combination of
        short classroom lectures,
        group games, and mock trading sessions. There is a curriculum of core
        subjects with flexibility
        to explore alternative areas of interest, and plenty of opportunities
        for close interaction with
        our traders.

        The software engineering programme focuses on the fundamentals of
        building electronic trading
        systems, OCaml, and the library and tools we use in our everyday work at
        Jane Street.
        Participants will put these tools to use by writing the back end and UI
        for a computer game,
        along with a program that trades on a simulated stock exchange. These
        activities involve a
        combination of classroom lectures, group games and exercises, and
        one-on-one mentorship.

        Selected students will arrive in London on the evening of Sunday, 20
        September and will depart
        the evening of Wednesday, 23 September. Jane Street will provide all
        travel to and from London,
        accommodation at a hotel near the office, and of course, plenty of food
        and drinks throughout
        the event.

        Jane Street is a quantitative trading firm that uses innovative
        technology, a scientific
        approach, and a deep understanding of markets to guide our business.
        Founded in 2000, Jane
        Street employs more than 1,100 people with offices in New York, London,
        Amsterdam, and Hong
        Kong. We are always on the lookout for great new people to join our
        team.

        The environment at Jane Street is open, informal, intellectual, and fun.
        The dress code is
        casual, the kitchen is stocked, and discussions are always lively.
        Teaching and learning are
        central activities through classes, mentoring, and discussion.
