    Does anybody miss skimming through action-packed digest emails from first
    term, hoping that one of your friends _actually_ read the whole thing so you
    can decide what to go to?

    There's tons in this digest for both this week and beyond! Be sure to check out
    our events especially - with upcoming committee elections, Valentine's Day (did someone
    say bar night? üëÄüç∫), a website building workshop and a V&amp;A trip, perhaps something
    will grab your attention! If you still aren't convinced, perhaps a **20% Nando's
    discount** will encourage you to read through the entire thing?

  <heading>ACI Talk - Automated Victim: Final Year Projects at Internet Scale</heading>
  <sponsor company="netcraft" />
  <event startDate="2019-02-12T12:00:00+00:00"
    endDate="2019-02-12T13:00:00+00:00"
    location="Huxley 308">
    <text>
      **Abstract:** Netcraft operates an industry-leading feed of validated phishing websites,
      which is licensed by all leading web browsers to protect their users. Over
      56 million unique phishing sites have been detected and blocked by Netcraft
      to date. The scale of the problem is vast: every day Netcraft processes
      millions of suspect URLs in order to identify new threats. URLs found to be
      phishing are included in the feed, whilst harmless URLs are discarded. Prompt
      classification of each site is essential in order to protect users from new
      attacks as soon as possible. To this end, Netcraft automates its classification
      of suspected phishing sites to the fullest extent.

      The "Automated Victim" approach to classification began as a DoC final year project, and now runs in
      production at Netcraft. It automatically mimics the behaviour of a human
      interacting with a phishing site - filling form fields, scrolling, and
      uploading files - in order to perform an accurate classification.
      We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, whilst outlining the
      challenges of scaling up from an undergraduate project to a distributed
      production system.

      **Speaker:** Tom Szyszko is a Computer Scientist at Netcraft, where he works
      on the development of automated phishing site classification techniques.
      He graduated from Imperial College London in 2018 with an MEng in Computing.
