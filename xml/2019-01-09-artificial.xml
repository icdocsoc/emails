    **[Artificial](https://artificial.io/)** has open positions for engineering
    internships on our serverless team.

    **Artificial**'s mission is to make insurance frictionless. With ArtifiicalOS,
    we're building market leading tools to radically improve the efficiency and
    profitability of insurance companies.

    With a need to rapidly scale a wide range of features for our clients, our
    insurance platform is compromised of **rapidly scalable microservices**, where
    technologies required include using Go, Node.js and Python to build serverless functions.

    We're looking for students who have demonstrated an interest in the
    technologies we use and push their skills by working on our platform. If
    you're an undergraduate who has undertaken projects beyond your course or
    have gained experience working with serverless and cloud technologies, we
    think you'd be a great fit for us.

    Interested in our **engineering roles**? To apply, click [here](https://artificial.workable.com/jobs/816324)
    and let us know your specific field of interests in the cover letter section.
