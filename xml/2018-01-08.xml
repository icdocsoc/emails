  <heading>Felix Seeking Tech Contributors</heading>
  <text>
    Felix, Imperial's weekly newspaper, is planning to expand its tech section
    after a successful first term and they figured Computing students might be
    interested in joining. The tech section covers popular science topics
    ranging from Formula 1 aerodynamics to gene drives, with the plan this term
    being to get involved with established electronics giants and review their
    upcoming gadgets and devices. Of course, the usual op-eds will make their
    appearance as well.
