    It is time for the DoCSoc International Trip and this year we will be going
    to Prague! ðŸ˜€

    The hotel chosen for this trip is Don Giovanni Hotel (4-star). You will be
    responsible for **buying your own flight tickets** but the hotel will be booked
    by us. You will be able to pay for the hotel via the Union website. This way
    we can stay together.

    The hotel will be booked for triple rooms (all single beds) from 25th May to
    27th May (2 nights). If you donâ€™t like this place you are welcome to stay
    elsewhere but you will miss out ðŸ˜‰

    Please head to the Union website:
    https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/shop/club-society-project-products/computing-products/26747/docsoc-goes-to-prague
    to secure your hotel booking. Once you have bought the Union ticket, proceed
    to buy flight tickets for 25th May morning departure and 27th May evening return.

    Note: the deadline to pay for hotel tickets on the Union website is Thursday 4th April at 12pm!

    If you are an international student and would like to go on this trip, please
    check out: https://www.vfsglobal.com/czechrepublic/UK/Tourist.html to find out
    whether you require a visa for this trip and the steps required to apply for
    a visa if needed (if you donâ€™t already have one). If you have any doubts about
    the visa application process, please contact us and we will be able to help.

    We look forward to having you join us in Prague ðŸ˜€
