    Next Jump is hiring!

    Next Jump is a ‘Deliberately Developmental Organisation’, on a mission to create high-performing
    workplace cultures across the globe. People development is at the heart of everything we do, and
    we follow this simple mantra: Better Me + Better You = Better Us. Next Jumpers train and improve
    themselves at work (Better Me) and use that knowledge to help others (Better You): together we
    create a better world (Better Us).

    With offices in New York, Boston, San Francisco and London, our cutting-edge e-commerce platform
    is used by 30 million employees across Fortune 1000 companies and generates $3 billion in sales
    every year. This fuels our social movement: changing workplace culture. We run immersive
    ‘Leadership Academies’ for C-suite leaders across all industries, such as, GCHQ, RBS and JP
    Morgan Chase, to help them build adaptive learning teams. We are rapidly scaling our HR
    technology to large organisations, with the help of a $10 million contract with the US Navy.

    As our core and social businesses continue to grow exponentially, we are looking for
    individuals, who are driven and willing to learn, to join us! If you want responsibility and a
    job that will challenge you and grow you, then Next Jump’s the place for you! We offer 3, 6, and
    12-month internships to penultimate-year students, as well as full-time roles to graduates.

    The application deadline for our 2nd November Super Saturday (assessment centre) is **midnight
    this Monday 21st October.**
