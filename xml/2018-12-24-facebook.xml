    Facebook is launching their 3rd run of Hack-a-project!

    This is a 5-week mentoring programme kicking off in February 2019, designed
    for 1st years of a three year degree and 2nd years of a fourth year degree,
    looking to apply for a Software Engineering internship with Facebook. Selected
    students will come to the Facebook office, once a week in the evening to learn
    about the whole development cycle and build a project as a team via a hackathon!

    In addition, we will be sharing tips on “how to crush your coding interview”,
    and also do a mock interview with you, where feedback will be provided to help
    you improve.

    Each session will also be catered, so come hungry (to learn and to eat!)
