    They will be available until Sunday 14th at 23.00, of course at rock bottom
    prices thanks to our [lovely sponsors](https://docsoc.co.uk/sponsors/).

    If you are unsure about sizing, please see the following pages: [Hoodie Sizing](https://www.spreadshirt.co.uk/personalised/detail/unisex-hoodie-PT1047?appearance=2) [T-Shirt Sizing](https://www.spreadshirt.co.uk/personalised/detail/unisex-tri-blend-t-shirt-by-bella+canvas-PT1212?appearance=228).
    We order unisex sizes - generally men should expect a tighter fit and women
    a looser fit.
