    Come to the Great Hall on Wednesday 9th October between 2pm - 5pm to have a
    chance to meet all of DoCSoc's Silver and Gold sponsors this year and grab some swag.

    Whether you are looking for an internship or graduate role, or simply want
    to know more about industry, we really recommend you come along as it's a
    great way to get in direct contact with recruiters and engineers from highly
    regarded companies and should provide invaluable insight into the recruitment process.

    This event is open to all DoCSoc members (automatically includes Computing, JMC, and EIE students).
