      Itâ€™s time for the first social event of the year (which is not a bar night
      of course)! Join us in a fun evening of solving puzzles and finishing clues.
      All you need to do is try to escape a locked room in 60 minutes in teams of 5.

      Tickets for this event will go on sale **today**! In order to purchase tickets
      for the event you first need to secure EVENTBRITE PLACEHOLDER TICKETS (https://lockedinaroom.eventbrite.co.uk).
      These will be released on Friday 2nd November at 1pm. Once you have secured
      a ticket on Eventbrite please head to the UNION WEBSITE (https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/shop/club-society-project-products/computing-products/24606/docsoc-gets-locked-in-a-room)
      to complete the purchase of your ticket BEFORE 3pm. Please ensure that you
      do not buy more than one ticket and any additional tickets will be voided.
      Please note that purchases without an Eventbrite placeholder ticket will be cancelled.
