    It's Tuesday!

    We kicked the week off with a whopping TWO events yesterday, the Docker
    workshop and the Valentine's Bar Night.
    Today (Tuesday) we're holding our Internship 101 event, where you
    can find out about internships at companies that are still hiring from past
    interns. And on Thursday we're running a Kotlin workshop at 18.30, which
    follows the lunchtime iPr0gram talk on the same day. Don't miss breakfast on
    Friday!

    Definitely a packed week! Check out below for more details and keep the
    biscuit suggestions coming!
