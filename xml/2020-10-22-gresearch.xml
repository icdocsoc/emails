    Join us for the G-Research Coding Challenge, where you'll compete in teams
    in a series ofprogressively more difficult software development challenges.

    Tuesday 27th October, 6:00 - 8:00 pm (GMT)

    Open to CompSci/Mathematics students in their penultimate or final years,
    the event will have teams of 3-5 people competing to build a natural
    language calculation engine (no prior NLP experience required). The
    challenges will cover things like evaluation of arithmetic expressions to
    unit conversions and equation solving.

    To register, just fill out the form at
    http://bit.ly/gr-coding-challenge-oct. Wewill allocate teams the week
    before the event (or if you would like to join asa team with friends, just
    let us know when you register).

    Please note, you will need a fully charged laptop, a good
    internet connection, Chrome or Safari, and headphones to take part.

    Once you have registered you will receive a unique link to join the event
    which you should use to log in by 5:45 pm (GMT), so that you can meet your
    teammates and learn how to navigate the online event space.  More
    information on the event will be emailed to you one day before.

    Once the game is complete, you will have the opportunity to stay online
    for some virtual networking where you can discuss the event and life at
    G-Research with members of our team.

    We'll be handing out prizes to the top three teams, with each member getting
    an Amazon voucher (£50 for first, £25 forsecond, £10 for third).
