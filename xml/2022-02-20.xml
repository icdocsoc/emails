  <heading>DoCSoc Netflix Stars</heading>
  <text>
   I used to think that some DoCSoc committee members were cast for roles in a Netflix [show](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7134908/) - would definitely suit their attitudes after all. 
   
   However, I haven't been hearing much gossip about it lately which makes me think it was false news, and, not gonna lie, I'm beginning to get sad :'( ...
