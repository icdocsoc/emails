    Hi everyone,
    
    It's that time of the year again - DoC is about to be joined by a new
    cohort of first years! And so, the DoCSoc Mums and Dads 2024/25 parent applications are now open!
    
    Every year DoCSoc members can become the "adoptive parents" of up to six freshers and
    form a family. It is not only a great way to welcome freshers and help
    them settle into university life, but for everyone involved to make
    some friends and enjoy some events together.

    We'll start with an event to meet your family on 9th October, and then each family will get a
    termly budget that they can decide how to spend themselves.

    **You can sign up as a parent [here](https://family.docsoc.co.uk/)!**

    Do not hesitate and sign up soon - the number of parents who can sign up is
    limited and the assignments will be made on a first-come, first-served basis.
