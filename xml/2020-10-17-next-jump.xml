    Join us for a night of fun and game on the inaugural
    Next Jump x DocSoc Olympics.

    Team up with your friends and course mates (up to 6
    per team) to challenge yourself to 3 + 1 rounds of
    brain-teasing and creativity-requiring challenges.
    Winning at the end of the event will get £20 Amazon
    voucher each and a chance to join one of our
    Community Online Academies to learn from by
    world-class trainers and thought leaders.

    You can expect:
    * Pub Quiz Challenge
    * Pictionary
    * Treasure Hunt
    * Mystery Head-to-Head round

    Don’t worry if you have not had a team yet as we can
    team you up at the event too. It is a perfect way to
    get to know others in the course and socialise with
    them too.

    You'll find more details in the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/263482351651310/).
