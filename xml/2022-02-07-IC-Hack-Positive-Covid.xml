  <text>
    Dear all,

    Thank you for coming to IC Hack and making this awesome weekend possible!

    Unfortunately, while everyone showed proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test before entering the event, we have now been notified that both a member of stuff and some participants tested positive for COVID-19 today. They were present for most of the event and they may have been around the same places you have been.

    Please take regular tests in the next few days and let us know if you or anyone else who attended tests positive. You can collect free LFD test kits from [various points](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/about/covid-19/testing-scheme/lfd-collect/) either on Campus or in Halls, including the College Main Entrance.

    Stay safe everyone!
