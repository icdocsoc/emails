      Traders in financial markets perform tasks that require them to absorb large amounts of data
      in limited time and make rapid decisions. Time is money and sub-optimal performance can cost
      firms hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Liquidnet augments the human expert with a
      variety of technologies, from anomaly detection pattern recognition algorithms to natural
      language generation and visualizations.

      **Join Liquidnet Chief Data Scientist Tom Doris, PhD.** to discuss challenges in adoption and
      adherence of new technologies by human experts, deconstruct the methods that were effective in
      overcoming the obstacles, and review similarities across other industries.

      There will be an opportunity to network with members of Tom's Technology team, our Recruitment
      Team and Product Team once the interactive session has ended.

      Refreshments will be served.
