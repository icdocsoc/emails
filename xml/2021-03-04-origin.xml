<email title="Where Tech Meets Business: An Insight into the Role of Junior Product Manager at Origin" agenda="false" logos="false">
  <text>

    Originâ€™s software has transformed the debt capital markets,
    completely streamlining the way companies and investment banks
    work together to raise capital. Having launched just over five
    years ago, Origin is now used by over 20 investment banks and
    90 borrowers in over 50 cities worldwide.

    As Origin has grown as a business, our team has grown too.

    We recently interviewed Romain de Spoelberch who joined us
    from Imperial in October 2020 as a Junior Product Manager. We
    talked about what his work entails, how his role offers
    proximity to both the code and the development cycle, and how
    his studies prepared him for a career in Product Management at
    a FinTech, as well as gaining an insight into his love of
    climbing, and the Imperial Union.
