  <heading>Imperial Mathematics Competition</heading>
  <text>
    Challenge yourself with maths puzzles in the third edition of Imperial Mathematics Competition!
    Round One of the annual contest will take place in late November, when contestants, from
    universities across the UK, will be given 3 hours to solve 6 problems individually. The top
    performers will be invited to Round Two (the final round) in Term 2.

    Sign up [here](https://icmathscomp.org/signup/). You can have a look at [past papers
    here](https://icmathscomp.org/pages/past-papers.html).

    Students from all departments are welcomed, both undergraduate and one-year master's. Some of
    the
    problems on the papers may require knowledge from the first year of an undergraduate course in
    Maths, much of which is covered in science and engineering courses as well. A separate team
    competition will be run in Term 2, with details to be announced in January.

    The deadline for signing up for the individual contest is **18th of November** and the
    competition will take place on **Sunday 24th November 9:30 - 12:30** in Huxley.

      **Please note this event has been rescheduled to the 19th of November. We apologize for the
      inconvenience.**

      Come and join us at our bi-weekly Reading Groups. This time we have Sophia Drossopoulou who
      will talk about her research "Holistic specifications for robust code". This talk is aimed at
      penultimate/4th year undergraduate as well as postgraduate students.

      Abstract
      Functional specifications of program components describe what the code can do — the sufficient
      conditions to invoke the component’s operations: a client who supplies arguments meeting that
      operation’s preconditions can invoke it, and obtain the associated effect. While
      specifications of sufficient conditions may be enough to reason about complete, unchanging
      programs, they cannot support reasoning about components that interact with external
      components of possibly unknown provenance. In this open world setting, ensuring that your
      component is robust even when executing with buggy or malicious external code is critical.
      Holistic specifications — as their name implies — are concerned with the overall behaviour of
      a component, in all possible interleavings of calls to the component’s operations with those
      of the external code. Thus, holistic specifications are concerned with sufficient conditions,
      i.e. what is enough to cause some effect, as well as with necessary conditions, i.e. what are
      the conditions without which an effect will not happen. By adopting holistic specification
      techniques, programmers can explicitly define what their components should not do, making it
      easier to write robust and reliable programs.

      In this work we argue for the need for such holistic specifications, propose a language
      Chainmail for writing specifications, give a formal semantics, and discuss several examples
      from the literature.
