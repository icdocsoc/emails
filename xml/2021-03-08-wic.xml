    Join DoCSoc and Women in Computing (WiC) for our Diversity in Industry
    panel, where we invite Imperial students and working professionals to talk
    about their experiences in relation to diversity &amp; inclusion in the
    Software Engineering and Financial industries, followed by a Q&amp;A
    session.

    Our inspiring speakers list includes:
    * An ex-quant market risk analyst and current EIE student
    * A cyber security lead at American Express
    * A MedTech startup founder and current EIE student
    * An infrastructure &amp; data lead at Optiver
    * An ex-CERN, ex-Morgan Stanley and current EIE student

    We will be covering the personal career trajectories of our speakers,
    followed by a dive into their company’s culture and the diversity &amp;
    inclusion initiatives that they have been involved in. Finally, we’ll
    explore the impact that COVID-19 had on these initiatives and briefly bring
    up the issue of diversity in upper management.
