    Have you ever heard about Capture the Flag, or CTF, competitions? No, I'm
    not talking about CoD's game mode or the outdoor game... If not, then
    you've been missing out! Now, you'll probably be asking "Well, what are
    they?" I'm going to answer by quoting an excellent blog post:

    "CTF (Capture The Flag) is a kind of information security competition that
    challenges contestants to solve a variety of tasks ranging from a scavenger
    hunt on wikipedia to basic programming exercises, to hacking your way into
    a server to steal data. In these challenges, the contestant is usually
    asked to find a specific piece of text that may be hidden on the server or
    behind a webpage. This goal is called the flag, hence the name!"
