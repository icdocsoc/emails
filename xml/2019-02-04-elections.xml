    **Leadership Elections 2019** are now open and nominations are now open for
    DoCSoc's 2019/20 committee. Nominations will run **until 12:00 on Friday 1st
    March**.

    If you're thinking of running to be on DoCSoc's committee, we'll be
    releasing more information over the coming weeks to let you know what each
    role entails. In addition to this, we will be holding a talk to explain each
    role and give everyone a chance to ask questions.

    The roles available for the **2019/20 committee** are:

    - President (FR)
    - Vice President (FR)
    - Treasurer (FR)
    - Secretary
    - 2 x Sponsors' Liason and Industrial Events Coordinator (FR)
    - Social Events Coordinator
    - Academic Events Coordinator
    - 3 x Events Officer
    - Webmaster
    - Marketing &amp; Publicity Officer
    - Game Dev Officer
    - Postgraduate Officer

    _Financial Responsibility (FR) roles entail being personally responsible for
    the financial transactions of the 2019/20 academic year, meaning you will
    be held financially responsible for your actions in office for up to seven years
    after the end of your term. It is strongly advised that those running for FR
    roles have prior committee experience at Imperial, ideally as part of DoCSoc,
    IC Hack or another large ICU society._

    Pack &amp; Election Rules](https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/your-union/leadership-elections-2019/information-for-candidates);
    breaking election rules can result in disqualification!

    In addition to this, DoCSoc will be holding our **general meeting today** in
    **HXLY 218 from 6pm to 8pm** and those interested in running are **strongly encouraged
    to attend**. Don't worry if you can't make this one; general meetings happen
    on a fortnightly basis. _(Please note this meeting will not be catered.)_
