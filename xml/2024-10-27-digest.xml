  <heading>Neurotech Society</heading>
  <text>
    The Imperial Neurotechnology society are putting on the second workshop of their 'Introduction to Neurotech' series, designed to give people of all backgrounds a foundation in the brain sciences and engineering used throughout the field. The 'Neurotech 102' workshop is all about the brain, covering:

    the foundations of neuroscience (the structure of the brain, how it is navigated, and what regions are responsible for what)
    an introduction to 'philosophy of mind' and what the mind/body problem is
    open questions in neuroscience, and how solving them will impact the world of Neurotech in the future
    The event is free, and open to all, irrespective of whether you have signed up to the society on the union page (although that is free and we highly recommend everyone to do so)!

    It will be on next Thursday, October 31st at 18:15 in RSM 1.31. We will post all communication about the event on our WhatsApp channel which can be joined here: https://chat.whatsapp.com/Ggk05q88JQR6doSkp8cApx

    Since it is Halloween after all there is a costume contest, with the best costume winning a pint (alcoholic or non-alcoholic) and curly fries!

    If you'd like any more information at all please get in contact with us via our email, neurotec@ic.ac.uk, or our Instagram @icl_neurotech!
