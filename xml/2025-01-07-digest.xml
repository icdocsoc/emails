      Ticket release on the [IC Hack website](https://ichack.org/), Thursday 17:00.

      Get ready for
      an entire weekend of free merch, food, and hacking...

      IC Hack is Europe's largest student-run hackathon, with 700 attendees,
      including 500 hackers and 150 volunteers. We're partnering with
      some of the biggest names in tech to bring you this event with
      lots of sponsors on site to help you with your projects and give
      you career opportunities.

      If you've not been to a hackathon before, here's the lowdown:
      you'll work in a team of up to 6 people to build a project from
      scratch in 24 hours. It's a great opportunity to learn new
      skills, meet new people, and have a lot of fun. We'll have
      tech talks, hot meals, snacks and lots of fun activities to
      keep you going through the night.

      And all of this happens on the South Kensington campus! We
      manage to get Sherfield kept open all night long...

      Keep an eye on our [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ichackuk/), [website](https://ichack.org/)
      and of course these emails for more information. If you'd like
      a taste of the event, check out our 
      [2024 montage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCASs8BVKGA) and

      Far beneath the majesty and splendour of the Paris Opera House, hides the Phantom in a shadowy existence. Shamed by his physical appearance and feared by all, the love he holds for his beautiful protégée Christine Daaé is so strong that even her heart cannot resist.
