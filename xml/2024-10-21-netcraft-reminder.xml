      ## DIY Takedowns: Disrupting Cybercrime with Netcraft

      Netcraft is hosting a deep dive workshop on leveraging vulnerabilities in criminal websites to effectively disrupt cybercriminals activities. This session delves into the advanced techniques and real-world scenarios where vulnerabilities can be exploited to counter phishing schemes, fake online stores, and other digital threats. As a leader in the field, Netcraft analyses over 10 million URLs daily and executes a cybercrime takedown every 15 seconds. However, as cybercriminals continuously evolve their tactics, itâ€™s crucial to stay ahead by understanding their infrastructure.

      The "DIY Takedowns" workshop offers an insight into what cybercrime disruption would look like if white-hat hacking was legal. Participants will be tasked with identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in criminal websites using the source code of real phishing kits that Netcraft has discovered over the years.

      After a short tutorial that introduces and demonstrates these key concepts, you will spend an hour actively taking down criminal websites. Points will be awarded for each successful takedown and the duration these sites remain offline. Throughout the challenge, Netcraft staff will be on hand to provide guidance and support, ensuring you gain practical, hands-on experience in safeguarding the digital world.

    Sign up [here](https://forms.office.com/e/LBEjRerj8B)!

      Please bring your laptop with you to the workshop and install the following software in advance:
      PuTTY [here](https://www.putty.org/), or an SSH client of your choosing.
