    carefully.

    Creating your teams before the event:

    Login using either a Google, Facebook or Microsoft account using this link
    https://puzl.ink/london

    You will then be directed to the team page, where you can join and create
    teams.

    - There are two types of teams; private ones which you will require a code
    to join or public ones which anyone can join.

    - Please note as the owner of a group you will need to approve people to
    join.

    If you are not able to join a team, there will be some time to join a team
    at the beginning of the event.

    If you have any friends that you think will want to take part you can then
    send them the link to join your team

    Please login at least 5 minutes early.

    We look forward to seeing you tomorrow!  Thanks,

    Bloomberg Engineering
