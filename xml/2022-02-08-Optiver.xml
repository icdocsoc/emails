    Hi all,

    Optiver has exciting news for students with serious coding skills. They’re inviting you to join TraderHack, a coding competition that dives into the fascinating world of algorithmic trading. While working in a team or individually, you’ll go head-to-head with participants from across Europe, the UK and the US. And there’s a major reward on the line for the team with the best code: up for grabs is a first-place prize of €10,000 for the team (or individual) with the best performing algorithm on Optiver’s simulated exchange.

    After 24-hours spent building and optimizing, your trading algorithm will be put to the test on Optiver’s live simulated exchange. Our judges will then determine the best performing and most creative solutions to land you a place in the top three teams. Do you have what it takes to program under the pressure of the markets?
