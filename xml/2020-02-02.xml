        Hi everyone,

        With IC Hack 20 on the horizon and so many more hackathons prepared (as you will see in this digest), February
        is bound to be full of hacking! This also is a good opportunity for anybody who did not manage to secure an IC
        Hack 20 ticket to check out the other events we have prepared this month. Besides Google Hashcode, we have
        also started organisation around Ed Tech Hackday and IC HealthHack, co-hosted by Bioengineering Society, ICSM
        Coding Society and MedTech Society (tickets to be released very soon)!

        More information on that below, so let's dig in!

            Want to know how to code but have no idea where to start?
            Tried to learn on your own but not really made any progress?

            Whether you've dabbled in programming before, or you barely know what a computer is, DoCSoc (Department of
            Computing Society) is once again running a course for you!

            After our highly successful (and award-winning!) series last year, we'll be repeating our beginners coding
            course starting Thursday, 30th January.

            This year the course is open to everyone! Just make sure to grab a ticket on Eventbrite to ensure you have
            pizza at the event! Let us know about any dietary requirements by emailing us at docsoc@ic.ac.uk.

            If you think you're not a beginner, you might be interested in our intermediate course:
            https://www.facebook.com/events/471162783560184/. This course is for people who have an understanding of
            basic programming concepts (either from Python, or other languages i.e. R, Matlab, etc), and will focus more
            on actual real-world usages of Python. If you're not sure if you fit into this category, feel free to PM us!

            Don't worry if you can't come to a few sessions, we will be posting all the material on the event page!

            Any questions at all please leave them below, and we hope to see you at the first lecture on Thursday, in
            Huxley 144.

            For those of you who have dabbled a little bit in programming before (Python or not) and want to learn more,
            DoCSoc is holding a free, 5-week course on intermediate Python!

            We expect you to know the basics of programming already - functions, conditionals, loops, basic data
            structures and types, etc, either from Python or other languages.

            We will cover a range of topics, such as object-oriented programming, good software engineering design, as
            well as applications of Python in statistics, sciences, machine learning/data science, and building web
            applications.

            The course will focus on enabling you to understand the underlying logic and thinking process of
            programming, in order for you to become self-sufficient in your own learning and future development.

            This event will be catered, but make sure to grab a ticket on Eventbrite to secure a couple of slices for
            yourself!

            Don't worry if you can't come to a few sessions, we will be posting all the material on the event page!
