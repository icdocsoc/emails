    It's that time of the week again that I send an email.

    We're gearing up for the candidate reveal and elections starting NOON,
    FRIDAY 2ND MARCH! Don't forget to vote at vote.union.ic.ac.uk from Friday
    onwards!

    The other big thing happening this week is Revel. If you have a ticket that
    you wish to transfer to someone else, please email docsoc@ic.ac.uk for help.

    Otherwise, see not so much below and have a nice week :).

  <heading>Status of Hoodies, T-Shirts, and Beanies</heading>
  <text>
    Hoodies and T-shirts have finally been ordered and are on their way. They
    will be arriving later this week, so you should be informed about
    distribution shortly if you ordered a Hoodie, T-shirt, or Beanie.
