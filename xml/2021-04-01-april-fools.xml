    Introducing **DoCSoceroo**, DoCSoc’s all new delivery service to expand into
    membership catering delivery service. From wine tasting to your go to
    G&amp;Ts to curly fries, you say it, we deliver.

    DoCSoc has acquired a majority share at Deliveroo
    ([**ROO**](https://www.londonstockexchange.com/stock/ROO/deliveroo-holdings-plc/company-page))
    via their recent IPO on 31/3, and will be releasing discounted shares that
    DoCSoc members are able to convert their unredeemed DoCSoc Deliveroo
    vouchers at the rate of 20 shares per voucher.

    Via this scheme, members could be able to redeem up to 60 shares at a time,
    and an early incentive to have double the shares if redeemed today, before
    noon.

    We aspire to provide our members quality service, at a fraction of the
    price. We, as the first UK university society to acquire a public company,
    are really glad to offer this sincere offering to our members as this is a
    once in a lifetime opportunity to get stonks.

    On top of our current [DoGSock
    lineup](https://docsoc.co.uk/articles/2020-04-01-DoGSocks/), we will be
    adding RooPockets for Delivery™, the DoCSoc branded delivery bags warming
    your food.

    You can now exchange your vouchers over at docsoc.co.uk/roo.
