    ## This year, our flagship Sponsors Exhibition that attracts over 500 students each year has gone virtual, on Hopin!

    Whether you are looking for an internship or graduate role, or simply want
    to know more about the industry, we really recommend you come along and
    tune in as itâ€™s a great way to get in direct contact with recruiters and
    engineers from highly regarded companies and should provide invaluable
    insight into the recruitment process.

    The event will take place on Wednesday 14th October 1-4pm.

    **Look out for sign up links, which we will send out soon!**
