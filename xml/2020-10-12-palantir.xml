  <text>
    Palantir is a software company that builds the world's leading software for
    data-driven operations and decision-making. Our platforms power critical
    operations for government and commercial clients in dozens of industries
    worldwide.

    Preserving privacy, safety, and accountability during a crisis that demands
    the large-scale processing of sensitive data: join us to hear from an
    engineer on Palantir’s Privacy and Civil Liberties team who will discuss
    how to design and deploy privacy-protective software that encourages
    responsible use - even in greatly pressured, rapidly changing
    circumstances.

    We look forward to seeing you there!
