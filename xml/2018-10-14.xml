    Hi again! It's time for another digest.

    In the past week, we held four events: the Mums and Dads meeting, Linux talk,
    Sponsors' Exhibition and the Bloomberg Decentralised App Development workshop.
    These events were an overwhelming success with a total attendee count over all
    four events of 1000. Thanks to everyone who participated and a special thanks
    to all of our volunteers!

    If you have any feedback about our events, feel free to [get in touch](mailto:docsoc@imperial.ac.uk).
    Additionally, if you want to help out at our events, be sure to join our
    [DoCSoc: Operations](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1509850436007222/) Facebook group.

    In the coming week, we have our first inaugural bar night of the year, the
    Welcome Bar Night, so stay tuned for more information and opportunities from
    our sponsors.
