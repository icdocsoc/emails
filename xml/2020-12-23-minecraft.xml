    Come and Join DoCSoc in a festive Minecraft night! We know this year has
    been extremely difficult for all of us and it will, unfortunately, be the
    same during the holidays. So we are inviting you to a game night hosted on
    a Hunger Games Minecraft server, generously lent to us by our friends at
    CGCU! The server IP will be posted shortly before the event on DoCSoc's
    Discord server! https://discord.gg/hc24ud6 ðŸŽ®

    CGCU will also be able to lend out 10 Minecraft accounts for those who
    don't have one! The account details will be sent shortly before the event
    to the first 9 students that submit this form:
    https://forms.gle/9LKVCnyzZ5oZ1H198 so if you'll need one, be fast!

    Feel free to bring along your dinner, some drinks and your festive mood!
