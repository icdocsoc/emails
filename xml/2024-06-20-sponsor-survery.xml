    Hi everyone,

    The DoCSoc committee hope you're all having a great time on your holidays and/or internships!
    We're currently recruiting sponsors for next year and would really value student input. 
    If you have a spare 2-3 minutes, we'd love it if you could fill out our '24/25 sponsor survey:
    https://forms.office.com/e/H8brbFPq3i

    See you all next year!

    Aidan (he/him) - DoCSoc Secretary '24/25
