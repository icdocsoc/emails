    ### Who are we?

    Thought Machine is solving one of the biggest problems in
    banking. Since we launched in 2014, our mission has been to
    liberate banks from outdated, legacy technology which makes it
    difficult for them to innovate in a world where the biggest tech
    brands such as Netflix and Spotify are operating in the cloud.

    Our flagship product, Vault, is a cloud-native, core banking
    engine built to run any type of bank - from established global
    banks all the way to new challenger banks. Vault is used by the
    likes of Lloyds Bank, Atom Bank, Curve and Standard Chartered.

    With a founding team drawn from Google, we have a deep culture
    of engineering excellence and we believe it is this which
    delivers a solution compelling enough to engender a seismic
    shift in the banking industry.

    We were ranked as the most desirable London fintech to work at
    by Sifted when comparing employee reviews on Glassdoor and named
    in Fintech 50 (2020). We pride ourselves on having an excellent
    internal culture, where we take cultural fit as important as
    technical fit when we make new hires. At Thought Machine, we
    strive hard to create a fast-paced, supportive and fun working
    environment to enable the team to produce the best technical
    work in the industry.
