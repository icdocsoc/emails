  <heading>What do we do?</heading>

  <text>
    We at DoCSoc are very passionate about our annual events. Here's what
    to expect in 2020/2021:

    - **Talks and workshops** - DoCSoc runs many engaging and interactive talks
    and workshops together with our sponsors, usually in the evenings after
    lectures. In the past, we've run workshops such as a credit card skimming
    competition with Netcraft, a Palantir Decomposition Workshop and an evening
    with the COO &amp; CIO of the London Stock Exchange Group. (Do not confuse
    with the Department's Applications of Computing in Industry talks.)

    - **Sponsors' Exhibition** - One of our biggest events, where you can meet
    our sponsors (this year virtually) and interact with them in a friendly
    atmosphere. More details coming soon!

    - **Revel and End of Year Dinner** - The two formal events hosted by
    DoCSoc. Taking place at the end of second and third term respectively, both
    events set up a fancy theme for you to enjoy with your friends, and a party
    that you will remember long after you have graduated!

    - **IC Hack** - Imperial College's flagship hackathon is one of our biggest
    and most successful events running for nine consecutive years! For 24 hours
    we take over the campus to create the most amazing hacking atmosphere for
    our attendees, while running mini-events and workshops such as NextJump's
    sleeping and meditation classes, games rooms and our grand karaoke! Lots of
    coding, prizes, food and fun is guaranteed! Check out last year's montage
    [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeCLwKQXxX8).

    - **DoCSoc Education** - We aim to share knowledge in a practical and
    engaging way and help students polish their professional and technical
    skills. Over the past year we ran successful events such as CV workshops,
    Internship 101, Building a personal website workshop, and our very well
    received Python lecture series.

    Throughout the year we also host a wide range of social events (such as pub
    quizzes, games nights) and academic events. Do you have suggestions for
    events? We're always looking for feedback so feel free to email us with
    anything you have in mind!

  <heading>How to get involved?</heading>

  <text>
    **Membership** - All of our events are members-only and as a departmental
    society, all students studying Computing, JMC or EIE are automatically
    DoCSoc members. For those _not_ on these courses, membership can be
    purchased on the [Union
    website](https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/activities/a-to-z/computing).

    **ICU Autumn Elections** - Imperial College Union Autumn Elections 2020 are
    now accepting nominations ‚Äì more details on [the Union
    website](https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/your-union/autumn-elections-2020).
    This election cycle you can run for the DoCSoc GameDev Events Coordinator
    role as well as for JMC and EIE department representative roles.

    **IC Hack** - No other event can compare to the scope of IC Hack and each
    year we put in a lot of time into organising the hackathon. From navigating
    Nando's orders and keeping track of the logistics to contacting and
    interacting with sponsor companies, we have a lot of open positions that we
    need help for. If you aren't looking to compete in the hackathon, lending a
    hand is a great way to participate so make sure to keep yourself updated
    for when we seek volunteers!

    **Keeping Updated** - Our weekly digest is only one of the ways you can
    find out about DoCSoc events. The best place to stay updated about events
    is via our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ICDocSoc/) and
    [Instagram](https://instagram.com/icdocsoc) pages. You can also find us on
    [Twitter](https://twitter.com/icdocsoc/).

    Don't forget that we run **group chats for every academic year** on
    Facebook Messenger. Other than Piazza (run by the department), Messenger is
    a central place for discussions so if you aren't part of this group chat,
    get in touch with us and we'll add you!

<heading>Palantir's Fall Events</heading>
<sponsor company="palantir">
  We invite you to learn more about Palantir ‚Äî straight from the source.

  Government agencies, commercial institutions, and non-profit organizations
  must wrangle an ever-growing amount of data ‚Äì raising important ethical
  questions for software companies like Palantir that help these institutions
  harness data to advance their missions.

  But because Palantir is not a consumer-facing company, it‚Äôs not always easy
  to understand what we build and how our products are used. Here‚Äôs your chance
  to learn more directly from our software engineers. Engineers will share how
  their focus has shifted completely in the last 6 months to help in the fight
  against COVID-19 on a variety of different fronts. We‚Äôll be sharing demos of
  our products and answering questions about Palantir and our engineering
  roles.
