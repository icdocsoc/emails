    There are less than 24 hours to vote in the Leadership Elections!

    If you haven't voted yet, **don't ignore this email and vote now**!

    These elections directly impact how student life will be shaped next year.
    For **Union sabbatical positions** (Union President, DPFS, DPCS, etc.) in particular,
    your officers will decide on how initiatives such as Meat Free Monday and the
    Union Shop makeover are run. Likewise, the next **CGCU and DoCSoc
    committees** will shape how DoCSoc is run next year, so if you have a spare
    five minutes, get voting!

    _Voting closes at 14:00 on Thursday 14th March._
