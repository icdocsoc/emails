    Join Team Imperial for Unicode 20/21 for the chance to impress some of the
    UKâ€™s biggest tech employers with your code, and win a trip to San Francisco.

    Unicode is an online university coding league, with Imperial selected as
    one of the 80 teams to compete. The competition is split across 4 leagues,
    with universities going head-to-head in bi-weekly fixtures. Each fixture is
    a coding challenge sponsored and created by an employer, and a win in each
    fixture will earn your team 3 points.

    The code challenges are completed online and  individually, with the top 10
    scores from each team used to give you the score in each fixture. With a
    trip to San Francisco on the line, increase your chances of winning by
    getting as many coders in your team as possible!
