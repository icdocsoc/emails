    Come to the Queens Tower Rooms on Tuesday 9th October between 5pm - 8pm to
    have a chance to meet all of DoCSoc's Silver and Gold sponsors this year
    and grab some swag.

    This year's exciting sponsors that will be attending include Facebook,
    Palantir, Bloomberg, Samsung, Netcraft, Microsoft, Next Jump, Entrepreneur
    First, NewVoiceMedia and Artificial Labs.

    Whether you are looking for an internship or graduate role, or simply want
    to know more about industry, we really recommend you come along as it's a
    great way to get in direct contact with recruiters and engineers from highly
    regarded companies and should provide invaluable insight into the recruitment
    process.

    This event is open to all DoCSoc members (automatically includes Computing,
    JMC, and EIE students).
