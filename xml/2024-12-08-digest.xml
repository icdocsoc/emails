  <text>    
    Exciting news! Advent of Code has kicked off, and we've set up a DoCSoc leaderboard for some friendly competition.

    Advent of code is a coding competition featuring a daily challenge for 30 days, with questions similar to those you would find on platforms like HackerRank.

    To join DoCSoc's leaderboard, go to adventofcode.com and enter the code:

    "2298315-a7afa1f4".

    There will be prizes in January for the ones at the top of the leaderboard üéÅü•á

    Happy coding!
