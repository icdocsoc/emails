    Hi all,

    We are writing to let you know that one attendee of yesterday's Rust 101 Lecture at HXLY 311 tested positive for COVID-19. They were present for most of the event and they were seated in one of the last rows on the left side (lecturer's point of view).

    Please take regular tests in the next few days and let us know if you or anyone else who attended tests positive. You can collect free LFD test kits from [various points](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/about/covid-19/testing-scheme/lfd-collect/) either on Campus or in Halls, including the College Main Entrance.

    Stay safe everyone!
