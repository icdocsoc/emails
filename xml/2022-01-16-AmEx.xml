    We are looking at recruiting strong talent from a Technology &amp; Computer Science background and would love to see if you are able to share the below event with any female students within your faculty?
    
    American Express is a keen recruiter of top talent and we would relish the opportunity to connect more closely with students that would see themselves having a career within Technology/FinTech.
    
    We are hosting a webinar next week and wondered if you are able to share this amongst the students you think would be interested? 
    
    The event is an exclusive **Women In Technology Event** on Wednesday, **19th January from 3.00pm â€“ 4.30pm** (UK time).
    
    This is an amazing opportunity to understand what Technology means at American Express and hear more about our software engineering internships on offer. Students can also hear from some of our female leaders and graduates on why they chose to start their career at American Express. Most importantly, they will get unique insights and gems into what we are looking for from candidates in the recruitment process.
    
    To attend, please ask students to register [here](https://aexp.eightfold.ai/events/candidate/landing?plannedEventId=LWm334nz).
