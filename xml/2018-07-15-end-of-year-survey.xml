    This has been a fantastic year for DoCSoc and we hope that you enjoyed all
    the opportunities we had to provide! With the academic year and (hopefully
    positive!) examination results out of the way, it's time to kick back and
    enjoy a well-deserved summer holiday.

    In order to give you even better events and opportunities next year, we
    would like to ask you to complete a short survey. In case you aren't convinced,
    we will also give a **£50 Amazon voucher** to three lucky participants. More
    details below.

    **WIN ONE OF THREE £50 AMAZON VOUCHERS**

    We’re currently in the process of writing next year’s sponsorship proposal
    and in the interest of increasing our sponsorship opportunities to benefit
    all of us, we’d like to collect some data about our performance this year.

    We're also interested in finding out how your experience has been so far
    with DoCSoc so that we can continue to improve our society.

    The survey is ANONYMOUS. If you wish to be eligible for the prize, we will
    ask for your username. However, we will NEVER use your username in
    conjunction with any of the other answers from this survey.

    Complete the survey here: [https://docsoc.co.uk/survey/](https://docsoc.co.uk/survey/)
