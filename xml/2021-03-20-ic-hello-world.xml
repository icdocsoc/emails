    ### Are you a coding wiz? Willing to exchange some help for some introductory hackers for some free food?

    [Sign up here](https://forms.office.com/r/esNJL3v3dp) to be a mentor at IC
    Hello World! We welcome 3rd, 4th, and postgrad students to help out!

    All mentors will receive a Â£20 Deliveroo or Amazon voucher. We have
    extended the sign up period until the end of today.

    We will be hosting our first meeting tomorrow at 2pm and will go
    through the logistics throughout the event.
