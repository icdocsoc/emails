    Hi everyone,

    With the unfortunate change in weather, we're regretfully postponing the summer barbecue. Our new (tentative) date for the barbecue is next Sunday (19th August).

    Don't forget to follow our Facebook event for further updates here: https://www.facebook.com/events/201855943797849/
