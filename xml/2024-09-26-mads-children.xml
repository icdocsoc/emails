    Hi everyone!

    Congratulations on getting into Imperial! We hope you're settling into your halls and are looking forward to freshers week.
    
    As mentioned in my email earlier, we'd like to invite you to take part in DoCSoc Mums and Dads.

    Every year DoCSoc members can become the "adoptive children" of 
    two 'parents' from upper years and form a family. It is not only a great 
    way to settle into university life, 
    but for everyone to make some friends and enjoy some events 
    together. Each family will also get a termly budget that they can 
    decide how to spend themselves.

    You can sign to be a DoCSoc family member here: https://family.docsoc.co.uk/

    The event where you'll meet your family will be on the 9th of October
    but we need you to sign up soon so we can match you up with your 'parents'!
