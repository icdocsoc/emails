  <heading>[ensemble]</heading>
  <event startDate="2024-12-01T12:00:00"
    endDate="2024-12-01T19:00:00"
    location="Entrepreneur First, Shoreditch, E2 8JF">
    <text>
      We're hosting a meetup for makers from across the UK! Come to see passion projects ranging from video games to apps, blogs, music, creative writing and artworks.

      [ensemble] is a full day dedicated to showing off cool projects people have been working on throughout the term at our different groups [craft], [scale down] and [orchard] (from Imperial, Cambridge and Oxford, respectively). We're co-working clubs, spaces and communities where people work on what they've been meaning to but haven't found the time nor space to do in the midst of life. Come for inspiration and to spark your own passions again.

      We're being hosted by Entrepreneur First at their offices in Shoreditch. Sign up [here](https://lu.ma/80g8dsqw) before space constraints kick in! (rumours say lunch and dinner are provided).
