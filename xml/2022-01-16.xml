    Do you need to wear glasses and often find yourself in a disadvantageous position compared to your peers because you simply can't read the code? 
    
    Then worry not, because we're introducing ICC Hack 22 just for you.

    More info will follow soon!

    Yours truly,
    
    I Can't C Hack 22 organizers

    P.S. C# will be banned from this edition of IC Hack. We also expect that you can't program in C.
