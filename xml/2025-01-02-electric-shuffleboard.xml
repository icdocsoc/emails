      Kick off 2025 in style with one of our BIGGEST events yet! We're taking over the iconic Electric Shuffle for a night of fun, food, and friends you won't forget. Expect lots of drink tokens and food to snack on throughout the night. Food, drinks and shuffleboard sessions will start at 20:00 and  will continue till 23:00! Don't worry if you want to keep going, as we will be hosting additional space and seating till close for those who want to stay for even more fun! 

      What's the Plan?

      Electric Shuffle is a cutting-edge venue that reinvents shuffleboard for the modern era with high-energy competition, amazing vibes and showstopping cocktails! There will be lots of free food &amp; you will get up to 5 drink vouchers throughout the session! We have subsidised this exclusive event to just Â£18 from Â£70.

      What is Electric Shuffle?

      It's shuffleboard, but cooler, slide pucks down a fancy table and aim to outscore your rivals. Add dazzling tech, competitive energy, and a buzzing atmosphere, and you've got the ultimate game night to compete against your fellow students.

      Initial ticket release will be Friday 3rd January @ 13:00 with a second release following Monday 6th January @ 13:00. Spaces are limited and will quickly sell out, so grab your ticket early and join u
