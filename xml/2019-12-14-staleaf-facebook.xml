  <heading>Facebook – Hack-a-project 2020</heading>
  <sponsor company="facebook">
    Facebook is launching their 6th run of **Hack-a-project**! Consider it an extended hackathon
    with learning and mentoring attached to it!

    This is a programme kicking off in Feb 2020, designed for 1st years of a three year degree and
    2nd years of a fourth year degree, looking to apply for a Software Engineering internship with
    Facebook.

    Selected students will come to the Facebook office, once a week in the evening to focus on
    understanding the whole development cycle, and build a project. Each session will consist of a
    talk, and practical applications with group mentoring support. Food will also be provided!

    In addition, we will be sharing tips on “how to crush your coding interview”, and also do a mock
    interview with you, where feedback will be provided to help you improve.

    **If interested in applying please follow the link below. You only need your CV to apply. All
    applications must be made by the 17th of Jan.**
