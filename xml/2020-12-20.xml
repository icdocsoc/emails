    Hi everyone!

    Congratulations for getting through this wild term!

    On behalf of the DoCSoc committee I would like to wish everyone Merry
    Christmas and a Happy New Year!

    We invite you to complete this wellbeing survey to help the Department
    improve the student support services: https://bit.ly/34oRIcW

    Get some well-deserved rest over the break and we'll see you in a couple
    weeks at our 2021 events!
