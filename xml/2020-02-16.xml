        Hi everyone,

        Now that we have settled well into second term, we hope you're all coping with your coursework. Although, we
        kept it silent this week (post IC Hack rest), we are coming back with more events than ever for you!\
        Besides, the hackathons and workshops that we run in February, we added some social events for next week, so you
        can take a moment to relax from all the universitycd ..
        work. Reading groups are also back! Also, we will be selling
        our second batch of tickets for Revel (first batch sold out in less than 15 seconds!) on **Monday 17th at
        1:30**.

        Read on for more information!

            Reading groups are back this term! Reading groups are sessions where researchers come and talk about their
            current work to expose current undergraduate students to research! These talks are open to everyone!

            Session 1 by Prof Abbas Edalat at 1-1.30 pm
            Title
            Algorithmic Human Development: What is it and why do we need it now?

            Abstract
            In the face of our current existential problems and challenges, I
            will argue by making a comparison with the origin of AI that we
            now actually need to develop algorithms to enhance emotional and social intelligence and creativity in the
            human
            individual. These non-invasive protocols would be based on neuroplasticity and long term potentiation and
            represent an interactive play between two internal agents: the emotion-driven Child and the thought-driven
            Adult
            equipped with an action programme. The protocols aim at neural retraining for optimal redevelopment and
            emotion
            self-regulation in the individual regarded as a biological cybernetic system with the targeted goals of
            becoming
            (i) compassionate, (ii) cheerful and (iii) creative. Our proposed framework, named Self-attachment, has
            parallels with Machine Learning as it employs the the basic paradigms of "rebooting", "substitution",
            "iteration" and "prior updating"
            in the human individual. I will give the results of a pilot project
            on the subject and describe two Bayesian computational brain models for it: one based on Hebbian artificial
            neural networks and one on the Free Energy Principle. I will finally argue that learning to laugh, in
            particular
            to laugh at oneself, is the number one learning task in our age and present novel protocols, based on
            logical
            theories of laughter, to explain how this learning can be acquired.

            Session 2 by Antonio Rago at 1.30-2 pm
            Title
            Argumentation as a Framework for Conversational AI

            Abstract
            As AI becomes ever more ubiquitous in our everyday lives, its ability to explain to and interact with humans
            is
            evolving into a critical research area. The explanation of a result, e.g. a prediction or a recommendation,
            in a
            way which allows a user to anthropomorphise a system is, therefore, a pivotal functionality in a user‚Äôs
            experience. We show how argumentative abstractions underpinning AI methods can provide the structural
            scaffolding for conversational explanations. We illustrate how the dialectical reasoning and conflict
            management
            capabilities of argumentation empower conversational repertoires in two different settings, recommender
            systems
            and automated review aggregation. We then demonstrate how the resulting explanations may be equipped with
            feedback mechanisms that guarantee that the system‚Äôs accuracy will improve with time or may simply be
            designed
            to induce trust in and provide transparency to users.

            You've made it halfway through term - come celebrate with us at the Valentine's Bar Night! Whether you've
            been bitten by the love bug or you're living life carefree, everyone's welcome for some free drinks.

            Drinks tokens will be given upon entry for FREE to DoCSoc members. Tokens are valid for both alcoholic and
            non-alcoholic drinks. We have the right to refuse tokens to members at our discretion.

            You are entitled to bring one non-Imperial plus one. ID must be shown at entry to prove this. You must stay
            with your plus one at all times and they will not be given any drinks tokens. Imperial plus ones must be
            DoCSoc members in order to attend.

            We may decide to head to Belushi's after the event; if this is the case, DoCSoc often buys attendees a round
            of drinks, so if you're unable to come to the bar night, bear in mind there is still a chance members will
            go out after!

            ----------------------

            You must be a member of DoCSoc before Saturday 15th February in order to be admitted. Computing, JMC, and
            EIE students are automatically members of DoCSoc. Membership is ¬£30. Strictly 18+ only - we will be checking
            IDs.

            Please send an email to us at docsoc@ic.ac.uk if you intend to bring a non-Imperial plus one. Any Imperial
            plus-ones must have purchased membership, otherwise they will be denied entry.
