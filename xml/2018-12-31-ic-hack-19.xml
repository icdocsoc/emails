    We will be releasing tickets in two ticket batches:

    - **Batch 1**: Thursday 3rd January 12:00pm GMT
    - **Batch 2**: Thursday 10th January 1:30pm GMT

    Tickets will be available at this link: https://ichack19.eventbrite.com/. Be punctual
    as tickets sold out in **less than a minute** last year!

    Both general and Imperial College student tickets will be available. You must
    be **over 18** on the date of the event to attend due to legal/venue requirements.

    **Please note**: If you are signing up for an Imperial student ticket, you must register with
    your @ic.ac.uk/@imperial.ac.uk email address. If you have just graduated from
    Imperial College, you are eligible to claim a student ticket.

    Be sure to follow our **Facebook event** [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/2239401369677547/)

    We look forward to seeing you at IC Hack 19 and hope you have a great start to the new year!
