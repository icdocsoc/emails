    **[Artificial](https://artificial.io/)** has open positions for Machine
    Learning internships and placements.

    **Artificial**'s mission is to make insurance frictionless. We're dedicated
    to building the most advanced and flexible machine learning enabled insurance
    platform to cater for insurers, brokers and underwriters of all sizes and sectors.
    You will be working on a complex product, still very early in its life cycle,
    where you will have a direct impact on its course.

    Our team works together from our head office in London, our office in Warsaw
    and from remote locations all around the world. Our London office is based
    near Cannon Street in the City, at the heart of London's insurance market.

    We're looking for someone with:

    - Strong programming skills (e.g. Python, Java or other object-oriented languages)
    - Awareness of Machine Learning concepts and related Python libraries, although hands-on experience is a strong plus
    - An interest in areas of application such as cloud services (AWS), deep learning, natural language processing and data visualisation
