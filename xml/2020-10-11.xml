  <heading>Autumn Elections - Year Rep Nominations Open</heading>
    <text>
      Nominations in the Union Autumn elections are **NOW OPEN** and close at
      **noon on Tuesday 13 October**!

      It is an opportunity to make your voice heard within the College and the
      Union.

      Every year students vote for an Academic Year Representative and
      Wellbeing Year Representative.

      The Academic Year Representative receives and collates feedback from
      their cohort, passing this information to the Departmental
      Representatives or staff as appropriate. Academic Representatives have
      made long-lasting improvements in many areas such as the content of
      curricula, feedback quality and timeliness, exam timetables and formats,
      and online learning resources.

      Wellbeing Year Representatives are part of the Wellbeing Representation
      Network, which aims to tackle issues such as stress and pressure, mental
      health, the quality of personal tutoring, how students are supported to
      be resilient and independent, transitioning back into study after time
      off, and more. Wellbeing Representatives will work with College staff,
      Welfare Officers, and Academic Representatives.

      Year reps make **real change within the department**, with a place on
      regular Staff Student Committee meetings, voicing their concerns to
      teaching fellows and staff.

      To nominate yourself and for more information on the mentioned and other
      roles available, visit the Union's [Autumn Elections
      page](https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/news/autumn-elections-2020).

  <heading>Netcraft ‚Äì Applications of Computing in Industry Talk</heading>
  <sponsor company="netcraft">
    Netcraft will be giving an ACI talk on Tuesday about the final year project
    of an ex-DoCSoc student made in partnership with Netcraft and now
    integrated in our systems. Netcraft have found that criminal infrastructure
    often purports to be located in jurisdictions with less effective legal
    systems, uncooperative law enforcement or anonymous company registrations.
    In reality, the infrastructure is often located in countries with good
    Internet connectivity and reasonable legal systems, like the Netherlands.
    In this talk, James will discuss the development of the system, its
    deployment at Netcraft, and some of the engineering challenges which have
    been overcome.

    If you‚Äôre interested in a career with Netcraft or collaborating on a final year
    project with us and want to find out more about what we do and how to
    apply, please check out our recruitment brochure at:

  <heading>Bloomberg Masterclass ‚Äì A New Era Of Python Parsing</heading>
  <sponsor company="bloomberg">
    Date: Wednesday, 14 October 2020

    Time: 15:00-16:00 London Time

    Apply: via [Yello](tinyurl.com/y6jbwy6t)

    The Parser was one of the first pieces that were created for Python and it
    has served very efficiently for many years; but implementing new rules in
    the language syntax is becoming more difficult or even impossible in some
    cases.

    In this talk, we will explain the problems with the old parser, how
    the new parser works, what are its benefits, and what to expect from the
    Python grammar in the future.

  <heading>Jane Street Estimathons 2020!</heading>
  <sponsor company="jane_street">
    **What is an Estimathon?!**

    The Estimathon is a team-based contest that combines trivia, game theory,
    and mathematical thinking. Teams have 30 minutes to work on a set of 13
    estimation problems, the winning team being the one with the best set of
    estimates. Since debuting the Estimathon in 2013, Jane Street has run over
    200 Estimathon contests.

    The answer to each problem is a positive number. Your team will submit
    intervals for each problem. Intervals may not contain negative numbers or
    zero.

    You may not use the internet, or your calculator/smartphone, or any other
    type of external reference material.


    **Scoring**

    An interval is good if it contains the correct answer. After the 30 minutes
    is over, the final score for your team will be:

    ![(10 + sum of (floor of (max / min)) over good intervals) * 2 ^ (13 - # of
    good intervals)](https://i.imgur.com/yAJFK2G.png)

    That is, for every problem you get wrong (or leave blank), your score
    doubles.

    The winning team is the team with the LOWEST SCORE.

    **Submitting intervals**

    Every team can submit up to 18 total intervals. Submit your intervals at
    any time throughout the contest.  There will be a scoreboard that will be
    updated in real time based on the intervals that are being submitted.

    **Re-submitting**

    Given that each has 18 answers and that there are only 13 problems, it is
    possible to submit intervals for a given problem more than once. If you do
    this, only the last submission for any given problem is the one that will
    count towards your final score. To put it another way: each submission
    (right or wrong) overrides any previous submissions for a given problem.


    If you could like to take part in one of our online Estimathons or
    CEstimathons (where questions are based on the world of computing and
    trivia) please visit our events page to register or click on the dates

    **Panel Q&amp;A: The Ins &amp; Outs of Palantir‚Äôs Interview Process:** Whether you‚Äôve
    already applied to Palantir or you are considering starting an application,
    we invite you to join us a for a panel discussion where we demystify
    Palantir‚Äôs interview process and provide tips on how you can prepare!
    You‚Äôll hear from interviewers, hiring managers, recruiters and engineers

    **Info Session: Palantir 101 + Product Demo** is an opportunity to learn more about
    Palantir straight from the source. Government agencies, commercial

    amount of data ‚Äì raising important ethical questions for software companies
    like Palantir that help these institutions harness data to advance their
    missions. But because Palantir is not a consumer-facing company, it‚Äôs not
    always easy to understand what we build and how our products are used.
    Here‚Äôs your chance to learn more directly from our software engineers.
    Engineers will share how their focus has shifted completely in the last 6
    months to help in the fight against COVID-19 on a variety of different
    fronts. We‚Äôll be sharing demos of our products and answering questions
    about Palantir and our engineering role.
