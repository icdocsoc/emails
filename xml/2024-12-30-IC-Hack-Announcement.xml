    We're back, baby! IC Hack 25 is happening **1st-2nd February** and 
    we'll be announcing ticket release dates soon. Get ready for
    an entire weekend of free merch, food, and hacking.

    IC Hack is Europe's largest student-run hackathon, with 700 attendees,
    including 500 hackers and 150 volunteers. We're partnering with
    some of the biggest names in tech to bring you this event with
    lots of sponsors on site to help you with your projects and give
    you career opportunities.

    If you've not been to a hackathon before, here's the lowdown:
    you'll work in a team of up to 6 people to build a project from
    scratch in 24 hours. It's a great opportunity to learn new
    skills, meet new people, and have a lot of fun. We'll have
    tech talks, hot meals, snacks and lots of fun activities to
    keep you going through the night.

    And all of this happens on the South Kensington campus! We
    manage to get Sherfield kept open all night long...
