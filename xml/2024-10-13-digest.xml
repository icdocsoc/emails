  <heading>Recruiting Design Volunteers for ICHack 25</heading>
  <text>
    
    Come volunteer at Europe's largest student-run hackathon! After some excellent design work last year, we're looking for 2-6 long-term volunteers for the ICHack 25 Design team.

    From ¬£10,000s in merchandise, to swag, posters, video graphics, the website or social media posts, IC Hack is an opportunity to contribute your design skills to one of Imperial's largest events.

    We're not just looking for graphics designers - last year we made videos in After Effects and Premiere, designed 3D printed cubes for hackers, and worked on the IC Hack website. We'll fund anything you want to make - the sky is the limit!

    If you're intersted, sign up [here](https://forms.gle/TQpRzPDgPjZmtWzx9)!
