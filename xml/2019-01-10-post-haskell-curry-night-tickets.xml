      Now that you've finished your first major exam at Imperial, we want you to
      take a well-deserved break and enjoy the delicious curry dishes of the famous
      Brick Lane, on us!

      So whether you want to celebrate smashing the exam or drown your sorrows
      in tikka masala, come join your fellow coursemates at the Sheba Restaurant
      on Sunday 13th Jan at 5pm for a great time and great food!

      ONLY first year Computing and JMC students are allowed to purchase tickets - they
      will be revoked otherwise.

      Tickets will be released on Eventbrite at 12pm on Friday 11th January 2019.
