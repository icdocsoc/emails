    Hi everyone,

    Last week was a busy week, with events including Revel, a Unity workshop, a talk from
    Palantir, election hustings and finally, our yearly health-related
    hackathon, Health Hack!

    With exam season for third and fourth years, as well as voting opening for
    the Leadership Elections, we have a quiet week planned ahead so all of us can try
    focus on some work. If you don't have imminent exams just yet, we do have a
    talk by an ex-Imperial student (and now-DeepMind employee) next Tuesday and
    a few other announcements to make. Read on!

    It's that time of year again where you get endlessly pestered by people asking
    for you to vote for them. That's right - it's time to vote for next year's
    DoCSoc committee and wider Imperial College Union roles.

    Voting opens tomorrow, Monday 11th March and closes on Thursday 14th March.
    Be sure to check out candidates' manifestos [here](https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/your-union/leadership-elections-2019/manifestos/a-to-z)
    and vote by going to https://vote.union.ic.ac.uk/!

    We would also encourage you to vote for CGCU and sabbatical roles too. Sabbatical officers
    such as the Union President and Deputy President for Finance and Services, as well
    as CGCU officers such as the President and Treasurer, all affect how well
    DoCSoc runs.

  <heading>What I Wish I Knew As An Imperial Student (presented by a DeepMind employee)</heading>

      Andrea Michi is an Imperial alumni who's spent the last 3 years working
      for Google and DeepMind. He'll be coming in to present on everything he
      would have loved to know before he started his job - a talk which has been
      very popular when presented internally at Google.

      Andrea will cover many soft topics often ignored in the tech industry:
      how to deal with rejections and failures, what you should prioritise at
      the start of your career, how to give, receive, and internalise feedback,
      how you can be a better teammate and a more efficient engineer.

    We launched the Palantir Women in Technology Scholarship in 2010 to celebrate

    women to pursue computer science, engineering, and technical studies, and to

    This year, 10 scholarship recipients will be chosen and invited to visit our
    London office for a full-day, all-expenses paid developmental workshop.
    Programming will include professional development sessions, breakouts with
    our engineers, and some fun social activities! All recipients are awarded
    grants of Â£5,500 to support their education.

    The scholarship is open to students who:

    -	Are active, full-time undergraduate or Master's students enrolled in an
    accredited European college/university during the academic years that the

    Math (STEM) fields
