      Come and visit our new office just outside of Waterloo Station!

      Our Head of Engineering, James, will be giving a talk about the awesome tech we use to run our
      e-commerce site that annually brings in $3 billion dollars of sales.

      Fun fact: Our platform serves over half a million users at peak during Black Friday week.

      Afterwards, we'll have some time for you to meet and chat with the amazing NxJers over free
      pizza and drinks.
      Can't wait to see you there!
