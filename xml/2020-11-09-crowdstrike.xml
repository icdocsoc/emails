    Where did the hacker go? He must have RAN SOMEWHERE

    Mission: Can you defend Imperial College London and its COVID-19 Vaccine
    Top Secret Information or will it be stolen by the Bad Guys?

    What’s Involved: Take part in a tabletop challenge with CrowdStrike experts
    to see if you can save your university from the eventuality of being
    hacked! With the guidance of our team, we’ll take you through a real-life
    scenario and help lead an investigation to see if you can save the day and
    restore Imperial College London back to a safe state of play.

    Logistics: This workshop will run for 1hr 30 minutes. Each student will be
    split into teams of 3-4 and entered into breakout rooms to discuss
    plausible solutions, to the attack that is underway. You’ll then in return
    hear from our experts to help pave the way for what we do next. We hope you
    find a solution so your university isn’t left to ransom! Prizes will be
    given to the best and most unique suggestions for saving your university!
    We look forward to seeing you!
