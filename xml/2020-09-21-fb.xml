  <text>
    Hi there!

    I am reaching out to make you aware of an opportunity you may be interested
    in.

    Facebook is running two EMEA wide virtual Crush Your Coding Interview
    Workshops in October for students interested in Software, Front-End,
    Security, Production and Network Engineering.

    During this event you will be run through coding interview questions and
    get the chance to ask Engineers about life at Facebook as well as tips and
    tricks for the interview process.

    This event is open to University students studying in EMEA.

    \*You MUST be an enrolled University student to attend this event\*

    If you are interested in attending either event, please apply by signing up
    to one of the links below. Please note, both events are the same format so
    we recommend attending only 1 event.

    * 7 October: http://crushyourcodingwithfacebook.splashthat.com

    * 22 October: http://crushyourcodingwithfacebook2210.splashthat.com

    Best wishes,

    Lucy Kemp
