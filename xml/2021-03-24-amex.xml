    ## Join American Express and DoCSoc for an amazing night and **£20 Deliveroo vouchers!**

    You might ask - what is **PowerPoint Karaoke**?

    Well, PowerPoint-Karaoke (also known as Battle Decks) is a game with very
    simple rules:

    The presenter gets on stage and must convincingly present a deck of
    PowerPoint slides he has never seen before.

    The main purpose is to have as much fun as possible.

    No preparations required – but come over and have fun!
