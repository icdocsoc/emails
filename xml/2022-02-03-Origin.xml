We have recently secured our Series A funding round lead by **Clearstream** and the **Luxembourg Stock Exchange**, and our CEO was named in the **top 10 leaders** transforming finance in Europe by Business Insider.

    Origin is looking for smart and driven graduates to join our team as **Graduate Software Engineers** as we rapidly grow our product.

Origin has a strong track-record in rapidly scaling up juniors so be ready to grow fast!

    We have a strong focus on testing &amp; code quality, as well as continuous learning (**Annual £500 learning budget**, hackathons, training platforms and conference attendance). We hold regular **company socials** and outings. All roles are part work from home (we provide a **WFH budget**).
