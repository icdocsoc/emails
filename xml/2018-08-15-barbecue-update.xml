      summer BBQ for free food, drinks and laughs.

      It will be held in Prince's Gardens from 1-5pm. Please click **Going** on
      the Facebook event if you plan on coming so we have enough food for
      everyone!

      While there will be lots of food, if you would like to bring some extra
      food or drinks, that would also be most welcome!
