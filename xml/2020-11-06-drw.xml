    ![DRW: Who We Are?](https://i.imgur.com/htkmpKf.png)

    Join DRW as the head of their London office, Neil Dunn, will come in to
    discuss how traders, software developers and researchers interact with one
    another and what their day-to-day looks like. We’ll also have a recruiter
    there to discuss the interview process.

    DRW is a diversified trading firm with decades of experience bringing
    sophisticated technology and exceptional people together to operate in
    markets around the world and across many asset classes. We value autonomy
    and the ability to quickly pivot to capture opportunities, and so we
    operate using our own capital and trading at our own risk. Headquartered in
    Chicago with offices in the U.S. and Canada as well as Europe and Asia, we
    trade all the things you’d expect from a leading firm, including Fixed
    Income, Equities, FX, Commodities and Energy. We also have leveraged our
    expertise and technology to expand into three non-traditional strategies:
    real estate, venture capital and cryptoassets.
