      At Marshall Wace we make extensive use of stream processing technology in order to build systems that process data quickly and at a huge scale (millions of events per second). This talk explains the basics of stream processing and the dataflow model, how it differs from traditional data processing, challenges involved, and where it works well (or doesn't!). No prior knowledge of distributed systems or real time data processing is expected! Knowing what a database is and the basics of any programming language is helpful.
