  <heading>Union Awards</heading>
  <text>
    This week, DoCSoc were proud to receive the Contribution to College Life award
    for our joint Diversity in Engineering event with the CGCU! We were also
    nominated for Club, Society and Project of the Year and Event of the Year
    (also for Diversity in Engineering). In addition to DoCSoc, many of our
    volunteers received individual awards, from the Outstanding Service Award
    to Union Colours.

    Congrats to everyone who won awards, and for our volunteers who didn't, this
    small awards ceremony was a testament to the level of gratitute many of DoCSoc's members
    have for those who actively help our society run our events, particularly volunteers
    on [DoCSoc: Operations](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1509850436007222/) and the
    many volunteers who made IC Hack 19 possible!

  <heading>DoCSoc CV Reviews</heading>
  <text>
    Got questions about your CV or internship applications?

    Though it's still early for the upcoming internship search season, some of
    you may want to get a head start. DoCSoc is currently rolling out a new
    initiative, where first and second years who want a CV review and advice
    can be matched with third and fourth years who are seasoned veterans of the
    job search process (and have also been trained by the college Careers Service!).
