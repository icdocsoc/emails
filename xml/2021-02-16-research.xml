    This is the question!

    Have you thought about doing a PhD and/or going into academia but you’re a bit uncertain what this is going to be like?

    We’ll be hosting Q&amp;A panel between academics and people that have a lot
    of experience in the industry (Robert Chatley, Paul Kelly and many others)
    answering your questions about a research career. Be that in academia or
    private companies, this type of career choice usually comes along with a
    lot of stereotypes and myths so we’re here to break it for you!
