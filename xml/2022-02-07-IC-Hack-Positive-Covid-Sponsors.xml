  <text>
    Hi XXX,

    Thank you for coming to IC Hack and making this awesome weekend possible!

    Unfortunately, while everyone showed proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test before entering the event, we have now been notified that both a member of stuff and some participants tested positive for COVID-19 today. They were present for most of the event and they may have been around the same places you have been.

    We would also kindly ask you to notify other members of XYZ who joined us since we don't have everyone's email addresses. In case you, or anyone else over at XYZ, tests positive then please let us know!

    Keep testing and stay safe!
