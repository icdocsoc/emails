    Hello everyone,

    Yeah, there was no digest last week. There wasn't much going on anyway.

    This week, however, there's a bar night! The final one of the term! It's on
    **SATURDAY**.

    We wish everyone the best of luck with their exams both this week and after
    the spring break. The digest will be back after exams!
