  <heading>Meet Your Family Week</heading>
  <text>
    With lockdown just having begun in England, we realise it is more important
    than ever to stay connected to one another. That is why we have made this
    week Meet Your Family Week! We encourage you to meet up with your DoCSoc
    families and do an activity together such as play Among Us, virtual dinner
    and drinks, play an escape room, or something completely different! If your
    family still has not reached out to you, please email us and we will try
    reallocate some parents and children.

      Join DRW as the head of their London office, Neil Dunn, will come in to
      discuss how traders, software developers and researchers interact with
      one another and what their day-to-day looks like. We‚Äôll also have a
      recruiter there to discuss the interview process.

      DRW is a diversified trading firm with decades of experience bringing
      sophisticated technology and exceptional people together to operate in
      markets around the world and across many asset classes. We value autonomy
      and the ability to quickly pivot to capture opportunities, and so we
      operate using our own capital and trading at our own risk. Headquartered
      in Chicago with offices in the U.S. and Canada as well as Europe and
      Asia, we trade all the things you‚Äôd expect from a leading firm, including
      Fixed Income, Equities, FX, Commodities and Energy. We also have
      leveraged our expertise and technology to expand into three
      non-traditional strategies: real estate, venture capital and
      cryptoassets.

  <heading>CrowdStrike: Help! My University Has Been Hacked!</heading>
  <image src="https://i.imgur.com/qxb0BwX.png"/>
  <event startDate="2020-11-11T18:00:00+00:00"

      Where did the hacker go? He must have RAN SOMEWHERE

      Mission: Can you defend Imperial College London and its COVID-19 Vaccine
      Top Secret Information or will it be stolen by the Bad Guys?

      What‚Äôs Involved: Take part in a tabletop challenge with CrowdStrike experts
      to see if you can save your university from the eventuality of being
      hacked! With the guidance of our team, we‚Äôll take you through a real-life
      scenario and help lead an investigation to see if you can save the day and
      restore Imperial College London back to a safe state of play.

      Logistics: This workshop will run for 1hr 30 minutes. Each student will be
      split into teams of 3-4 and entered into breakout rooms to discuss
      plausible solutions, to the attack that is underway. You‚Äôll then in return
      hear from our experts to help pave the way for what we do next. We hope you
      find a solution so your university isn‚Äôt left to ransom! Prizes will be
      given to the best and most unique suggestions for saving your university!
      We look forward to seeing you!

      In this talk Jonny Hancox, Senior Data Scientist from Nvidia‚Äôs Healthcare
      team, will showcase the many tools and techniques that can be used to
      reduce the time it takes to move from ideation to insight. Much of this
      acceleration comes from the developments in hardware, but also the
      algorithmic developments that these hardware innovations have unlocked.
