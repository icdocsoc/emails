      **Our first event of the year for people looking to find out how to prepare for internship
      interviews** and see what life is working in a financial services company.

      ---

      At Macquarie, we look for innovative, driven and talented students who share our drive for
      excellence. People who drive their own success, are high calibre, motivated and creative.

      Is this you? Then come to our event to find out more about Macquarie and the role of
      technology in the financial sector, including some of the exciting projects we are working on
      in this space.

      An interactive session will help you experience some of the ways in which we interview
      candidates for our technical interviews, and we will have plenty of time for you to chat to
      our graduates over pizza and soft drinks where you can ask them any questions you might have.

      We look forward to meeting you!


      This event will be catered with free pizza and soft drinks as usual! **Please RSVP to help us
      gauge our food ordering requirements.** If you have any specific dietary requirements, please
      let us know a few days beforehand by emailing docsoc@imperial.ac.uk
