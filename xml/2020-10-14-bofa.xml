    # Imperial DocSoc | Meet the Technology Teams

    Technology touches everything we do and underpins
    each deal we make. In fact, our mainframe environment
    is the third largest in the world. That said, we
    don’t believe that there is a tech ‘type’. You don’t
    need finance experience to join us and D&amp;I is at
    our core. Our Global Technology and Operations
    (GT&amp;O) division gives our business the
    competitive edge to solve business problems by
    delivering high quality and practical solutions.

    Join our Meet the Technology Teams session to speak
    directly to members of our Imperial Tech School Team.
    The event will provide an open forum where you will
    have the opportunity to ask questions on a range of
    topics including careers in Global Technology, how to
    apply and general working life at Bank of America.
    Please come prepared with your questions to be
    addressed at this session.
