    Facebook Hack-a-project is **closing applications soon**!

    For first and second years looking to gain valuable, hands-on programming
    experience by building real-world applications, Hack-a-project is a great
    programme. Previous students who went along to Hack-a-project gave very
    positive feedback, so do be sure to check out this opportunity if you have
    not yet done so!

    This is just a gentle reminder that we are **closing applications** for our 3rd run of **Hack-a-project on Feb 1st 2019**.

    This is a 5-week mentoring programme kicking off in February 2019, designed
    for 1st years of a three year degree and 2nd years of a fourth year degree,
    looking to apply for a Software Engineering internship with Facebook. Selected
    students will come to the Facebook office, once a week in the evening to learn
    about the whole development cycle and build a project as a team via a hackathon!

    Each session will also be catered, so come hungry (to learn and to eat!)

    Please take a look at the video from our last Hack-a-project to find out more https://www.facebook.com/265781023507354/posts/2024153967670042/.
