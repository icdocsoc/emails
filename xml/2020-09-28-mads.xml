    Hi there!

    Congratulations once again for getting your place to
    study at Imperial College London, Department of
    Computing!

    The term begins in a week and one of the schemes put in
    place to help you adjust to your university life is the
    Mums and Dads scheme! You will be allocated into a
    family within the department who you can turn to for
    help with the course or just generally adjusting to the
    university lifestyle.

    With the term fast approaching, please remember to sign
    up (https://mad.docsoc.co.uk/fresher) for the scheme
    ASAP to make sure you are matched with the best family
    possible.

    #### How does it all work?

    Parents are existing 2nd, 3rd,
    and 4th year Computing and JMC students in DoC. Each
    family will consist of two parents and up to four
    freshers. This year, due to the unusual circumstances,
    family activities in the Autumn term will be held
    remotely. There will be a range of opportunities for
    you to bond with your family, starting with a virtual
    pub quiz. Each term there is also a small budget for
    each family (around 20 pounds) to use as appropriate.

    #### I've already signed up on the union(CGCU) website. Do I sign up here too?

    Yes, please do. If you haven't
    signed up on the union website, then you don't need to,
    as long as you sign up here. But even if you have
    signed up on the union website, please sign up here as
    well!

    Regards, \
