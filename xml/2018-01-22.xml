    Another week, another digest!&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Yeah it's
    Wednesday..&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

    Check out our DoCSoc Education volunteering initiative below to teach
    Python to life sciences students. It's a great way to get experience in
    teaching students! Also, IC Hack 18, Internship 101, and an Accenture
    competition!

    Without further ado...

  <heading>Volunteers Needed for DoCSoc Education</heading>
  <image src="https://i.imgur.com/VKAshFk.png" alt="Coding 101 Banner" />
  <text>
    *As you may have heard, we're starting a new initiative called DoCSoc
    Education aiming to teach students from other courses to code.*

    Our first venture will be [teaching Python to students from life sciences
    courses](https://www.facebook.com/events/333505960463269/), and we could
    definitely use some volunteers to help. You don't have to be amazing at
    Python - if you're interested in helping, let us know by either sending us
    an email (docsoc@imperial.ac.uk), or PMing us on
    [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ICDocSoc/).

    soon! Like in past years, it's a panel-style event where you share your
    experience in a very short 5-10 minute talk. You don't need to have great
    public speaking skills, but be ready to answer questions about the company.
