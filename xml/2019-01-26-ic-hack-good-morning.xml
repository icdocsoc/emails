    Good morning Hackers!

    Just a reminder that registration takes place from **10am at Imperial College's
    Main Entrance**. The Opening Ceremony starts at 10:45am, so make you arrive on time!

    Our address is **Imperial College London, Exhibition Road, SW7 2AZ**. If you're travelling
    on the tube, get off at South Kensington and take the subway, exiting at the very end
    (following signs for Imperial College) and turning left. If you're still lost,
    take a look at Google Maps Street View [here](https://goo.gl/maps/HjrGCw8eGAU2).

    At the entrance, have your **QR code** ready either on your Eventbrite app or on paper
    and make sure you bring a **valid form of government ID** (driving license or passport).
    Note that we cannot admit you without these documents.

    If you have any questions, feel free to ask them on the _#helpdesk_ channel
    and if you're looking for a team, join the _#team-forming_ channel.

    Finally, be sure to make good use of the **#ICHack19** hashtag on social media!
    We'll be keeping our eyes on Facebook and Twitter throughout the event, so do
    let us know what you're up to during the event.
