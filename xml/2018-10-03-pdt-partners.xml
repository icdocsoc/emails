      PDT Partners - a boutique quantitative trading firm - is thrilled to partner
      again with Imperial for its 2019 Industrial Placement and Internship programs.

      We're hosting an open house the day before the Sponsors' Exhibition to give Imperial
      students an opportunity to check out the office, and meet some of the engineers
      we have working in the office while enjoying some food and drinks.
