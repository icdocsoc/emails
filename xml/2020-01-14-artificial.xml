        _Already applied to us? Email us and let us know if you haven't yet expressed
        interest and/or prior experience in Haskell or serverless technologies._

        **[Artificial](https://artificial.io/)** is hiring engineering placements with
        a specific interest in either functional programming or serverless technologies
        for two of our teams:

        - **Build** - with challenges including modelling complex insurance contracts where correctness is key, the
        Build team is looking for candidates with a keen interest in **functional programming, type theory/type systems
        and Haskell**;
        - **Serverless** - with a need to rapidly scale a wide range of features for our clients, our insurance platform
        is compromised of **rapidly scalable microservices**, where technologies required include using Go, Node.js and
        Python to build serverless functions.

        **Artificial**'s mission is to make insurance frictionless. From building the
        foundation to scalable, market leading insurance software with ArtificialOS,
        to leading the future of pricing and claims with machine learning, we're
        building market leading tools to radically improve the efficiency and
        profitability of insurance companies.

        We're looking for students who have demonstrated an interest in the
        technologies we use and push their skills by working on our platform. If
        you're an undergraduate who has worked with Haskell beyond the first year
        course (perhaps choosing Haskell for your WACC project) or have gained experience
        working with serverless and cloud technologies, we think you'd be a great fit
        for us.

        Interested in our **engineering roles**? To apply, click [here](https://apply.workable.com/artificial/j/E7BBC6B3FB/)
        and let us know your specific field of interests in the cover letter section.
