    Hi all,

    We're excited to announce that we've secured tickets to see Interstellar at the BFI IMAX... Get ready to watch 70mm IMAX on the UK's largest cinema screen for the 10th anniversary of Interstellar's release!

    In the near future around the American Midwest, Cooper, an ex-science engineer and pilot, is tied to his farming land with his daughter Murph and son Tom. As devastating sandstorms ravage Earth's crops, the people of Earth realize their life here is coming to an end as food begins to run out. Eventually stumbling upon a N.A.S.A. base 6 hours from Cooper's home, he is asked to go on a daring mission with a few other scientists into a wormhole because of Cooper's scientific intellect and ability to pilot aircraft unlike the other crew members. In order to find a new home while Earth decays, Cooper must decide to either stay, or risk never seeing his children again in order to save the human race by finding another habitable planet.

    Tickets release [here](https://tickets.docsoc.co.uk/events/docsoc/1543414/r/mailshot) at Â£12 pp on Wednesday 22nd January at 13:00.
