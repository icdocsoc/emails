    Arrival is accelerating autonomous and electric vehicle technology, by
    fusing AI with new forms of automotive engineering. Arrival recently placed
    1st in LinkedIn's Hottest UK Startups of 2020, is one of the world's newest
    Unicorn's and has won numerous design awards for its new standard of
    zero-emission vehicles and technology products.

    Arrival is reinventing the automotive industry with its entirely new
    approach to the design and assembly of electric vehicles. The company’s new
    method uses low CapEx, rapidly scalable Microfactories that can be placed
    anywhere in the world to serve the regions they are located in. These
    Microfactories, combined with proprietary in-house developed components,
    materials and software, enable the production of best in class vehicles
    that are competitively priced to fossil fuel variants. This transformative
    approach reduces the costs of production and emissions of shipping, and
    does not require massive upfront investment, creating strong unit economics
    for the whole of Arrival’s product portfolio, including its electric van
    and bus announced earlier this year.
