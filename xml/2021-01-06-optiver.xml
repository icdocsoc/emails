    The exciting world of electronic trading is a problem solver’s paradise.
    However, to truly put your skills to the test, you’ll need to know some
    secrets of the trade. It’s time to learn some… Tradercraft.

    Hosted by Optiver trainer, Robbert Pullen, this interactive training course
    delves into the theory and techniques of modern-day trading and market
    making. You’ll get access to Optiver’s proprietary virtual trading
    platform, Optibook, and gain a deeper understanding of how to develop and
    analyse trading algorithms. You’ll also be shown how best to optimise them
    for different financial instruments using your knowledge of Python and have
    the support of experienced industry professionals.

    There’ll also be prizes up for grabs for the top performers including:
    Nintendo Switch gaming system (1st), JBL Charge 4 bluetooth speaker (2nd),
    Gaomon S620 graphics tablet (3rd)
