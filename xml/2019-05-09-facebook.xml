    Are you interested in cyber security? Join Facebook's Product Security team
    at our London offices for an evening of networking and talks about security here at Facebook.

    Facebook's London Product Security team or PSAA is part of a global team who
    are focused on discovering potential weaknesses and then crafting creative
    solutions to eliminate those weaknesses. We achieve this by doing security
    reviews, code and design reviews, building tools and automations through our
    WhiteHat program. The team is spread across three offices, Menlo Park, Seattle
    and London and works cross functionally with software development teams.
    Testing code for vulnerabilities building out longtime security tools and
    protecting against anomalies or vulnerabilities. We aim to make life hard for the bad guys!

    Our security team are focused on making Facebook a safe and secure place for
    the 2 billion people on our service to connect and share with each other.
    We're fortunate to have some of the brightest security minds at Facebook,
    and they are working around the clock to help protect people's Facebook accounts.
