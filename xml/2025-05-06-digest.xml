  <heading>DoCSoc Labs Kitchenette</heading>
  <text>
    We will be cleaning and reorganising the labs kitchen over the weekend, so please make sure to remove all personal items from the fridge and cupboard space by this Friday 9th May. You are welcome to return them after Monday 12th May once we have cleaned and restocked the space :)

    Also as a note, please make sure to keep the kitchen clean and tidy when using the coffee machine and other appliances, it is a shared space and is the students responsibility to ensure that everything is left in a clean and safe state. Make sure to not leave items rotting in the fridge, and clean up any spills after yourself

    If you have any questions then please send us an email!
