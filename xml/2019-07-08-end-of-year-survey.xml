    Hi everyone! We hope that you had a successful year and are enjoying
    your holidays! As we are diving into the summer break, it's time for us
    to reflect back on the past year and we would love to hear your opinion
    too.

    In order to give you even better events and opportunities, we would like to
    ask you to complete a short survey. You also have a chance to win a
    **£30 Amazon voucher**, which we will give to three lucky people who have
    filled in the survey. More details below.

    **FILL IN THE SURVEY TO HAVE A CHANCE AT WINNING A £30 AMAZON VOUCHER**

    We’re currently in the process of writing next year’s sponsorship proposal
    and in the interest of increasing our sponsorship opportunities to benefit
    all of us; we’d like to collect some data about our performance this year.

    We're also interested in finding out how your experience has been so far
    with DoCSoc so that we can continue to improve our society.

    The survey is ANONYMOUS. If you wish to be eligible for the prize, we will
    ask for your username. However, we will NEVER use your username in
    conjunction with any of the other answers from this survey.

    Complete the survey here: https://docsoc.co.uk/survey/
