    Join Facebook this summer at Wayfinder.

    Hosted at our office in London and Dublin, Wayfinder is an opportunity to
    experience our culture, explore opportunities and engage with the teams
    that make this all possible.

    Open to undergraduate students across all areas of study, Wayfinder allows
    you to explore more about your career pathway and gives you insight to what
    it is like working here at Facebook, where the journey is only 1% done.
