    Welcome back to another edition of the DoCSoc digest!

    IC Hack 18 is over! Thank you so much to all our sponsors and to everyone
    who participated and volunteered - it has been an incredible weekend! If you
    haven't already (and even if you have), watch the event montage [here on
    YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hngr7ts45Dc).

    While everyone is recovering, we're glad to finally announce a couple of
    events, and we're also looking for speakers for our upcoming UROP 101 and
    Internship 101 events. See below :).

    Lastly, I've been delibrating the place and relevancy of the weekly biscuit.
    Over the weeks that I've written the digest, coming up with a biscuit every
    week has become quite a burden. Therefore I propose several options
    pertaining to the future of the biscuit:

    - Weekly biscuit, chosen by YOU.
    - No biscuit. Just nothing.
    - Some other kind of confectionery.
    - Something else?

    [Please submit your votes here so that we may democratically decide the future of the biscuit.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuJkKLu6KQPJMJpHEd8wJyRFqWvRf9IH8Q3pZYZ4quGvmoIQ/viewform)

  <heading>Call for Internship 101 Speakers</heading>
  <text>
    Have you worked for a company in the past who are currently still accepting
    applications? Share your experience with your fellow coursemates at
    Internship 101!

    We're looking for speakers to speak at our Internship 101 event, happening
    soon! Like in past years, it's a panel-style event where you share your
    experience in a very short 5-10 minute talk. You don't need to have great
    public speaking skills, but be ready to answer questions about the company.

    If this is something that you would like to do, please email us at
    docsoc@imperial.ac.uk.

      This week Thursday (1st Feb), as part of the College's
      'Diversity@Imperial' campaign, the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion
      Centre will be hosting a lunchtime lecture on 'A Sense of Belonging in
      Engineering', given by Dr Nike Folayan.

      Dr Folayan is the Chairperson of the Association for Black and Minority
      Engineers (AFBE-UK), a national organisation to support and promote BAME
      engineers and engineering students through their careers in their
      respective industries. She will be discussing what diversity and the drive
      towards a more inclusive STEM workforce really mean, with a particular
      focus on the importance of diversity and inclusion in engineering.
