      Get out your scarf and gloves, and join us at the Natural History Museum
      for our annual ice skating spectacular on Tuesday 20th November at 6:30pm!
      DoCSoc will be heavily subsidising tickets to just Â£3! We only have a limited
      number of tickets for this session, so make sure to try and get one. If you
      do not manage to get a ticket, we will definitely be holding another session,
      so don't worry!

      Tickets will go on sale on Thursday 15th November at 1pm. In order to
      purchase tickets for the event you first need to secure **Eventbrite placeholder tickets** - https://docsocgoesiceskating.eventbrite.co.uk.
      Once you have secured a ticket on Eventbrite please head to the **Union website** - https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/shop/club-society-project-products/computing-products/24917/docsoc-goes-ice-skating
      to complete the purchase of your ticket **BEFORE 3pm**. Please ensure that
      you do not buy more than one ticket as any additional tickets will be voided.
      Please also note that purchases without an Eventbrite placeholder ticket will
      be cancelled.

      The ice skating starts at 7pm, so we will be meeting at 6:30pm at the
      entrance of the Ice Skating Rink.

      We hope to see you there!
