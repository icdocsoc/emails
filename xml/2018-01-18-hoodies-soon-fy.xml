    Hello everyone,

    You're receiving this email because you recently purchased a DoCSoc hoodie,
    T-shirt, or beanie! Congrats! We will be ordering the hoodies and T-shirts
    very soon, and will send another email when they are ready for collection.

    We will offer several collection opportunities in the labs, but if you are
    still unable to collect then, you can email us with a time and date that
    works for you and we will do our best to accommodate you.

    As a final year student, you are able to customise your hoodie with your
    name. You may fill in [**this
    form**](https://goo.gl/forms/XKwVLMvC803EVVwJ2) to inform us of what to
    print. If you choose not to fill the form or forget, we will not print your
    name on your hoodie. **Please let us know by midnight on Saturday 20th
    January.**

    You'll hear from us again when we have the hoodies.
