        **Come enjoy a Pub Quiz Night with Next Jumpers!**

        As a company, we love playing games and get especially competitive when we play against each other. So, we
        thought, why not bring some of that fun to DoCSoc. It will be an awesome evening for drinks, games and to test
        you on your general knowledge!

        We even have a small prize in store for the winning group. So, get your teams ready and we hope to see you
        there!

        Should you be looking for more than just a fun evening, we are actually hiring! We offer full-time roles to
        graduates, as well as 3, 6, and 12-month internships to penultimate year students.
