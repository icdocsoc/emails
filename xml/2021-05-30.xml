  <heading>Level-Up Society Hackathon</heading>
  <sponsor company="showcode">
    ### A 48-hour hackathon, giving you the chance to help level-up society through gamification.

    ## Registrations for our global online hackathon are now open 🌏

    You can register for the hack now, either as a team or as an individual! If
    you don't have a team don't worry, you can find one on our [Discord
    Server](https://discord.gg/fUJBrWvxhg) 👾

    ## 🤔 Why join our hackathon?

    * Compete for the chance to win our £5,000 main prize, as well as our
    sub-category prizes 🤑

    * We'll have some awesome workshops in the build-up to the hack, and
    experienced mentors over the weekend to help guide you through 💡 

    * Either compete in a team with your friends, or join a team and make new
    ones! We're a bit biased, but a hack is a great way to engage with people
    😎

    ## 💻 When and where

    * ⏰ The hack will get underway on Friday July 16th at 18:00 BST with our
    intro session on YouTube live. We'll give you the full brief, judging
    criteria and everything you need to start the 48-hour hack!

    * 👾 As it's online, we'll run the event through our Discord Server with
    mentorship and breakout sessions available throughout the weekend. You'll
    receive updates via email and the link to [join our
    Discord](https://discord.gg/fUJBrWvxhg) once you've registered, so check
    your junk if you don't have anything!

    ## 🚀 What you'll have to do

    All will be revealed in our intro session 👀👀 we don't want anyone getting
    a headstart so we're keeping our lips sealed. All you need to do is
    sign-up, and start thinking about an idea that could help Level-Up Society.
