  <text>
    Do you want to help encourage diversity and equality in Computing and
    represent your view? The Equality, Diversity and Culture Committee (EDCC)
    strive to continually maintain and improve equality and diversity amongst
    staff and students. Their current objectives are:

    No staff or student should be disadvantaged because of their gender,
    ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability or any other protected
    characteristics (Equality Act 2010).

    * The Department should provide an inclusive environment for all staff and
    students.

    * The Department should strive for diversity of staff and students along
    all dimensions.

    * The EDCC welcomes anyone to come and attend their bi-termly meeting to
    discuss such matters - all discussions are open!

    If you feel you have experienced something you would like to discuss
    however do not feel comfortable attending the meeting please do one or all
    of the following:

    * Talk to your year reps as they can discuss the issue for you.

    * Submit anonymous feedback by form here:
    https://edcc.doc.ic.ac.uk/contact/

    * Email anonymously to doc-equality@imperial.ac.uk - the exchange will be

    As machine learning models grow increasingly larger in size, exploring
    novel ways to train supersize models faster and more efficiently is a high
    priority for the whole AI community.

    ## GraphcoreFollow-the-leader Strategies using IPUs from Ford Motors AI
    Labs

    ![Watch the Random video walk](https://i.imgur.com/Z57DowT.png)

    Check out the new paper from Ford about a follow-the-leader model using
    IPUs to track pedestrian direction and speed. The model uses classifier and
    regression DNNs with grouped convolutions to boost model performance and
    reduce parameter count and compute latency.

    Throughput is boosted by 3.5x for training the classifier and 7x for the
    regression network.
