This term, we're introducing a brand new student-led curriculum for learning how to make advanced websites from scratch - no previous knowledge required!

The course will teach industry standards and give you a wide range of skills that will be applicable to **Topics in first year**, **Web apps in second year**, hackathons, and beyond into your career.

There are no prerequisites for this course - just bring a laptop and yourself. We'll start with basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript in the first week, then move onto advanced topics such as databases, deployment, maintenance, and security.

**This workshop is designed as a whole 10-week course, and will be held every Thursday at 6pm. Be sure to join the [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1770637513199253/) to receive more updates!**
