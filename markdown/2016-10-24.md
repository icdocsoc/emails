# Netcraft: Phishing for Fun & Profit

* **When:** 1st November 2016, 6:30pm
* **Where:** Royal School of Mines (RSM) G01
* **Facebook:** [Click here](https://www.facebook.com/events/1192142094162007/)

*"Give a man a phish and he feeds you for a day, teach a man to phish and he feeds you for a lifetime."*

Want to make some quick money without spending months writing code? Easy! Use a phishing kit!

You have "found" some phishing kits - targeting banks and payment systems used by people all around the world - and are ready to go phishing. The kits look sophisticated: accurate IP address control lists, to serve benign content to security and hosting companies; compelling mail lures; an SMS gateway account to send texts; and a scanner to find and hack into all those juicy WordPress sites...

You've got to be careful though - you know that the criminal masterminds who have written these kits will have used every conceivable trick to send themselves a copy of the stolen credentials when their code runs (these kit authors like to reap all the rewards without doing the legwork of setting up the phish!). Before you start your phishing attack, you have to find each and every one of those covert channels, replacing them with locations under your control. If you miss just one, then you'll be giving away all of your credentials for free!

Pizza and drinks will be provided at the event.

Today's critical institutions don't just protect public safety or provide vital goods and services - they also deal with astonishing amounts of data.  At Palantir, we build software that lets organizations integrate and analyze their data to solve problems they couldn't before.  For example, we're helping our customers combat terrorism at home and abroad, investigate and prosecute financial fraud rings, offer more credit to retail banking customers, manufacture products faster and more safely, and fight violent crime in the world's great cities.  And we're just getting started.

Come join us at our hands-on problem solving event and learn from full-time engineers about how we approach these problems.  We'll explore real-world examples similar to those mentioned above and challenge you to come up with solutions.
