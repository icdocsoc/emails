# Buddies Lunch
- **When**: 12th October,  1-2pm
- **Where**: Huxley building - Room 341/342

Being a fresher in Computing/JMC is a fantastic experience.
However, we bet you have loads of questions:
*What to do in London, How tough are the courses going to be, should I apply for an internship?*

To guide your first steps, you will be automatically assigned two parents.
Parents are older students who will be for you a reference point for any question you have.
Come on Monday 12th to have lunch with your parents!
**More information on what happens will follow in a future email**
