Hey there! You are being emailed because you purchased either a **DoCSoc hoodie** or a **JMC hoodie** back in March.

If you still haven't collected yours, drop by labs **on Tuesday (13th June) between 4pm and 6pm**, and look for a [DoCSoc committee member](https://docsoc.co.uk/about) (we shouldn't be hard to find!). 

This is the third and **final pickup** date we will be organising this year. It will become much harder to collect your hoodie after this, so please make every effort to pick it up if you haven't already - if you are on a placement currently, we understand and will attempt to unite you with your hoodie next year.

Thanks,

Tom & Alessandro
