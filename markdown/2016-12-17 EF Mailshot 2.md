This year has been an incredible one for DoCSoc - with our biggest and best year ever, we've held more events than ever before, and we certainly hope you've enjoyed all the opportunities that have been made available to you, either by our sponsors or otherwise.

Next year, one of our aims is to focus our sponsorship more so that you can get even more out of DoCSoc. For that, we need your help! We have prepared a short (<5 minute) survey that we'd appreciate you filled out so we can learn a little bit more about our members. 

**To sweeten the deal, one lucky person will win a Nintendo Switch for participating!**

The survey touches a little bit on our events this year, and also about our sponsors. To fill it out, please follow the link below:

Please share this link with all your DoCSoc friends! The more members who fill it out, the better we can understand how to improve next year!

*<small>You must have been a DoCSoc member since before April 4th 2017 to be eligible to win the Nintendo Switch. Computing, JMC, and EIE students are automatically members. Prize winners will be communicated once the survey is deemed over by DoCSoc, the organisers.</small>*
