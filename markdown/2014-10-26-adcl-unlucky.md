**Sorry...**

Hey there! Amazon signups are now closed. We had an absolutely enormous amount of interest, but unfortunately we can only take a limited number of people.

If you're reading this, or didn't receive a confirmation email, it means we unfortunately didn't manage to squeeze you onto the list. We're really sorry about this - we tried to be as fair as possible in how we allocated spots to different years, and we simply couldn't take everyone, much as we'd love to.

Do keep your ears open for any further opportunities. It should be noted that this in no way stops you applying to Amazon for an internship or graduate position - it's just an office visit!
