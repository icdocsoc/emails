# Search for a Student Blogger
Do you ever feel restrained by the language restrictions of programming? Want to try your hand at some creative writing, where you can express what you want, however you want and only worry about errors of the spelling kind? Want to be responsible for showing the world that computing students **DO** go out and **CAN** have fun? 

The truth is, our [blog](http://docsoc.co.uk/blog/) has been neglected... And we need **you** to bring it back to life. 

If you would be interested in coordinating the blog, or even just writing a single blog, please contact docsoc@ic.ac.uk us as soon as possible!
