Please join us for dinner and a presentation on Signac, a startup funded by Palantir
 Technologies and Credit Suisse. We will discuss: 

* Why Palantir and CS decided to launch Signac as new company
* How Signac is using technology and data to stop employee fraud and reduce operational risk at banks
* What it is like working at our startup
* Members of the Signac engineering, HR, and corporate teams will be there to answer your questions.

### More about Signac:

Major financial institutions are integral to the stability of our economy and our society. But many of the world's most influential banks are old institutions with legacy IT systems and mountains of underutilized data. As a result, they struggle to measure and identify risk, which is problematic for everyone because of their power and function in today's global economy. 

Signac works with financial institutions to detect fraud and reduce risk to make our financial system safer. We deliver powerful software and innovative programs to help banks catch unauthorized trading and other fraudulent activity, while taking proactive steps to reduce their overall operational risk. You can learn more about us at [www.signac.net](http://signac.net).

**Today's event will also be attended by Signac CIO, Sean Hunter.**

Sean Hunter is Signac’s Chief Information Officer. Prior to founding Signac, he worked as a Forward Deployed Engineer at Palantir Technologies where he led trader oversight partnerships with large financial institutions, including Palantir’s work with Credit Suisse. Before Palantir, Sean was a strategist in the securities division at Goldman Sachs. Over a period of 8 years he worked on various desks including equity exotics and hybrids, mortgages and algorithmic trading. Prior to GS he was IT director at a dot-com startup, writing their initial systems and managing a growing development team through two IPOs. Sean used programming to fund a postgrad in Jazz and used to be a professional bass player.
