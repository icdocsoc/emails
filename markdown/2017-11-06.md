<!-- Introduction Text -->

Hi all,

Firstly I'd like to apologise for multitude of broken links in recent DoCSoc
communications. We always do our best to ensure that emails we send out are
correct, but sometimes things to slip through the net.

While there are no events happening this week, you can grab yourself some
tickets to our Early AlphaGo Movie screening, or maybe attend our Capture the
Flag Coding Dojo on Wednesday.

Schrittwieser.

WATCH THE TRAILER: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tq1C8spV_g>

On March 9, 2016, the worlds of Go and artificial intelligence collided in South
Korea. The best-of-five-game competition, coined The Deep Mind Challenge Match,
pitted a legendary Go master against an AI program that was still learning to
play the world’s most complex board game. AlphaGo chronicles a journey from the
backstreets of Bordeaux, past the coding terminals of Google DeepMind in London,
and, ultimately, to the seven-day tournament in Seoul. As the drama unfolds
before an audience of over 280 million viewers worldwide, more questions emerge:
What can artificial intelligence reveal about a 3000-year-old game? What will it
teach us about humanity?

Directed by Greg Kohs with an original score by Academy Award nominee, Hauschka.

Due to the expected popularity of the event, we will be ticketing admission
(FREE). The first batch of tickets will be released on Tuesday 7th November at
12pm, make sure you don't miss them!

# CTF Coding Dojos

A few weeks ago, we asked about your interest in Capture the Flag coding dojos,
and many of you expressed interest.

Starting this Wednesday, there will be a weekly CTF Coding Dojo and meetup
session in Huxley 308, 3-5pm. It's open to anyone and everyone who is interested
in the area, including complete beginners. If you enjoyed the Netcraft event,
then you might want to come along!

We'll start off with a short tutorial to get you going, then you'll hack away at
challenges that get progressively harder- but don't worry, guidance will be
provided and this is a non-competitive environment. The goal is to learn, teach
and improve with fellow students!

# Academic Reading Groups

Our second Programming Languages academic reading group is happening next week
on Tuesday, at 1pm in Huxley room 145. Please check the website
<https://docsoc.co.uk/papers/> for updates on this date and the exact agenda.

Thank you for providing your feedback on our first Programming Languages
academic reading group. We've looked through this feedback and will allocate
more question time in forthcoming events by reducing the number of
speakers to 2.

That's all for now!

Until next time,
