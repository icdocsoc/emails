# GoCardless Job/Internship Opportunities

**GoCardless**: GoCardless is building a simple, intuitive system on top of Europe's broken payments infrastructure. Thousands of merchants already rely on us to collect millions of pounds every day. Right now, we're reimagining how enterprise software should work and look. To do this, we're looking for engineers that are strongly user-focussed and care as much about figuring out which features to build as the technical implementation.
