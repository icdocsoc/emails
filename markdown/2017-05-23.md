<center>![](http://i.imgur.com/tjnbbNE.png)</center>

---

Well, well, well. What a week we have lined up for you. It doesn't look like a lot if you say it quickly, but there are a ton of opportunities available for you all this week. Firstly, if you want to get involved in the backend of DoCSoc next year, don't forget to check out our by-election, and if you were disappointed by the cancellation of our end-of-exam celebration last Friday, then don't miss it this Wednesday! If you're interested in Women In Tech at Palantir, then we have a great opportunity for you, or if you didn't manage to pick up your hoodie last Saturday, then check below for more times you can collect. There's a lot more, but read on for the nitty gritty information! Without further ado...

# DoCSoc By-election Nominations Now Open!

<center>![](http://i.imgur.com/iPOcuCN.png)</center>

* **Apply by:** 29th May 23:59

You may remember the Leadership elections from last term when the next generation of DoCSoc committee members were chosen in order to carry on the work we've done this year on into next year. Unfortunately, nobody ran for some of our positions! So, if you're still interested in helping shape DoCSoc next year (and perhaps you ran for another role but weren't lucky enough to get it), you might want to put your name forward for one of our remaining roles:

* **Secretary:** This is my job. Your role would consist of organising committee meetings, creating agendas, taking minutes, replying to emails, and writing this - the digest email!

* **GameDev Officer:** You would be in charge of running GameDev Society - a sub-society of DoCSoc. You will manage your own GameDev budget, and organise meetups and competitions related to the GameDev society.

DoCSoc roles, whilst very time consuming, are very rewarding and not only look create on your CV but also help to develop new skills such as teamwork, initiative, organisation, and communication. To apply for these roles, click [here](https://vote.union.ic.ac.uk).

# The 1st Computer Games & Picnic

* **Where:** Hyde Park
* **When:** **<span style="color:red">RESCHEDULED TO TOMORROW!</span>** 24th May, 5-7pm
* **Facebook:** [Click here](https://www.facebook.com/events/825351934283247/)

**<span style="color:red">THIS EVENT HAS BEEN RESCHEDULED TO TOMORROW (WEDNESDAY) OWING TO THE POOR WEATHER LAST WEEK!</span>**

**SECOND YEARS:** We computing students are a breed of our own. We are the people of free t-shirts, fierce independence and abstractions of abstractions that no one will ever understand. Come on Friday at 11:30, we will also have survived what is probably the toughest part of our degree. 3 weeks of living in a library, shit food and stats curve balls.

In order to celebrate this monumental occasion, we will be hosting The 1st Computer Games in Hyde Park at 12:30. In around an hour and a half, Computing students attending will fight for the honourable title of Computer Games Victor.

DoCSoC will be providing **free drinks** (alcoholic or not), and snacks to all participants. Bringing a picnic of your own / food to share with fellow coursemates is strongly encouraged.

**For any questions, contact [Oliver Stenbom](https://www.facebook.com/ostenbom), and see you there!**

# Palantir Women in Tech Mentorship

<center>![](http://i.imgur.com/jSmsJNE.png)</center>

At Palantir, we're passionate about creating a diverse workforce - not only within our walls, but throughout the tech sector. The Women in Technology (WiT) Mentorship Program will pair women engineers from Palantir with women in their penultimate year of university to share guidance, experience, and lessons learned navigating the tech community.

Over a three-month period, each participant will have the opportunity to seek advice from an engineer at one of the world's top tech companies. Our mentors are looking forward to sharing tips on everything they wish they'd known more about when they left university: preparing for interviews, negotiating salaries, handling impostor syndrome, having difficult conversations in the workplace, pursuing technical growth, integrating work and personal life, aligning work with your values, and more.

# Hoodies Update (Friday Collection!)

* **When:** 26th May, 5-7pm

Did you purchase a DoCSoc or JMC hoodie last month on the Union website? If so, good news! We'll be distributing these on **FRIDAY** in labs. Come any time between **5pm and 7pm** to collect yours. We'll probably only organise one more pick up time after this, so do try to make it on Friday if you couldn't come on Saturday.

# Mentality Mental Health Survey

A fellow society of ours, Mentality is carrying out a survey to find out how effective mental health support is at Imperial. They really need people to (anonymously) tell them about their experiences so that they can try to improve the support system and the atmosphere at Imperial in an appropriate way guided by the needs of students. It would be fantastic if you could spare a few minutes to help them out, and hopefully in the long run it will benefit you and your fellow students, too.

**Fill in the survey [here](https://imperial.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_03co6hnl1gflfSt?Q_).**
