# Applying for SW Engineering Roles - Application Overview and Writing a CV

* **Where:** Huxley 311
* **When:** 16th January 2017, 6pm*
* **Who:** Nic Prettejohn
* **Facebook:** [Click here](https://www.facebook.com/events/1203257676462134/)

**A talk from the 2015/16 DoCSoc President!** IC Hack is right around the corner. In addition to hundreds of eager hackers, there’ll be dozens of representatives from technology companies looking to recruit engineers. To apply for a place, one will have to supply a CV.

The recruitment process for Software Engineers is very different to other graduate roles. Much of the time generic advice doesn’t cut it, or will fall short of warning about the unique challenges applicants face. 

Written for first and second years with none or little experience of applying for software engineering roles, this talk is the first in a series of three. **We kick off by introducing the structure of the application process and present a no-nonsense guide to writing a CV / resume from scratch.**

*  Application Overview and Writing a CV *- January 16th, 6pm*
* Technical Interviews (Workshop) *- Workshop during IC Hack*
* Non-technical Interviews, negotiation, and capitalising on an internship. *- TBC*


### About The Speaker

Nic Prettejohn graduated from Imperial with a BEng in Computing in 2016, and currently works as a Palantir Forward Deployed Engineer. Between 2015 and 2016, he was president of DoCSoc. *Speaker’s views are their own. Talks are purely educational and are not part of any sponsorship relationship with DoCSoc.*
