# Equality in DoC

DoC's Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Committee are looking create some services which allow people to get support or give feedback on the department's approach to equality and diversity.

The current suggestions are having an anonymous web form, several email contact points, and/or a phone hotline.
It would be great if you guys could let me know which of these services you would prefer, or let me know a different approach which might be more useful.

If you'd like to get involved, message Jonathan Sutton on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Jonny.Sutton1), or drop him an email (js7814@ic.ac.uk). He'll then pass on this feedback to the committee at the next meeting.
