Hi all,

Apologies for my absence last week, I'm sure I was greatly missed. You can stop
avoiding me in labs now (please!). I'm healthy again.

This week we finally bring you the AlphaGo Movie screening, and we're just as
excited for this as you are! If you don't have a ticket yet, they're still
available and you can find the ticket link below! Get your non-DoCSoc friends to
attend too!

For all those who were lucky enough to get tickets, the Ice Skating is happening
on Tuesday (today) at 18.00. Remember that we'll be meeting at the main entrance
at 17.15 and walking down to the museum together.

Finally, DoCSoc is running a Secret Santa exchange this year. It'll be a great
opportunity for you to get a gift for a random DoCSoc member and for you to
receive a gift as well. The whole process remains anonymous, so do be creative
when selecting a gift! If this sounds like something that you'd like to get
involved with, you can sign up here: <https://docsoc.co.uk/secret-santa>.

'Where is the end of your intro paragraph, Nik?', I hear you ask. They're not
usually this long. Without further ado...

Our upcoming events:

# Weekly Capture The Flag Sessions

- **When:** Every Wednesday, 15.00-17.00
- **Where:** HXLY 308, Huxley Building

Just a reminder that we have weekly CTF sessions every Wednesday 3-5pm in Huxley
308.

First, we will give a quick overview of computer networks and then make our way
through progressively harder challenges (covering topics such as HTML forms,
sanitisation vulnerabilities, and SQL injection). Bring your friends if you'd
like, and as always, we would love an interactive format, so don't be shy!

**WATCH THE TRAILER: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tq1C8spV_g>**

On March 9, 2016, the worlds of Go and artificial intelligence collided in South
Korea. The best-of-five-game competition, coined The Deep Mind Challenge Match,
pitted a legendary Go master against an AI program that was still learning to
play the world’s most complex board game. AlphaGo chronicles a journey from the
backstreets of Bordeaux, past the coding terminals of Google DeepMind in London,
and, ultimately, to the seven-day tournament in Seoul. As the drama unfolds
before an audience of over 280 million viewers worldwide, more questions emerge:
What can artificial intelligence reveal about a 3000-year-old game? What will it
teach us about humanity?

Directed by Greg Kohs with an original score by Academy Award nominee, Hauschka.
