# Mental Health First Aid Lite Workshop

- **When**: Tuesday 15th December 4:30pm - 7:30pm
- **Where**: Meeting Rooms 1 & 2, Union Building

Computing is tough. Really tough. And quite often the course impacts the
well-being of ourselves and our friends. Mental Health First Aid Lite is a
course being run by the Union. The course aims to teach how to identify stigma,
relate to other people's experiences, and how to look after your own mental
well-being.

An *extremely* worthwhile course, being run for the second time. The costs are
being subsidised by the union, and DoCSoc will reimburse the remaining cost
making it **free** for any computing students.

Please see [this link](https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/whats-on/event/2613)
for more info.

There are *very* limited places so please sign up only if you can make it.

# Student Blogger

Our [blog](http://docsoc.co.uk/blog/) has been neglected. All we need is a quick blog with a picture and a sentence about our various events so we can show the world we are an active society and also, keep a log of all the great things we are doing. 

If you would be interested in coordinating the blog, this doesnt necessarily mean writing them all but ensuring the blog is up to date, please contact docsoc@ic.ac.uk as soon as possible!
