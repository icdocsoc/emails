Once again, welcome to another edition of DoCSoc's Weekly Digest! First of all, you probably expected to get this email on Monday. Well the truth is that there's so much to include this week that I decided to hold off a bit. Next week, expect to be extremely busy with awesome DoCSoc events from our Sponsor event on Tuesday to one of our campus-famous Bar Nights on Thursday. There's also some pretty good information about Internships in here which you might be interested in if you haven't already secured one. Be sure to give it a good read and you're bound to find something of interest!

# Experimentation at Skyscanner

* **Where:** Huxley 308
* **When:** 24th January 2017 6:30-8pm
* **Facebook:** [Click here](https://www.facebook.com/events/382075402144411/)

The value of experimentation is well known, and yet the implementation and scaling of experimentation from niche to pervasive is frequently a stumbling block and an area that business of all sizes struggle in. Colin McFarland, Head of Experimentation at Skyscanner, led the global travel search business from small-scale experimentation to a state where experimentation is an ingrained practice, with hundreds of experiments undertaken a month, in just over a year.

This talk will give practical steering in how to augment experimentation within a business, looking at the case for causality, common pitfalls to avoid, the importance of building tooling and education, and driving the data-focussed culture that is so essential in delivering a competitive edge.

**In true DoCSoc fashion, this event will be catered with your favourite Italian meal. Find out more information on the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/382075402144411/).**

It's time for the first Bar Night of 2017! Once again, we'll be meeting in the Union Bar at 7pm for an evening of free drinks (alcoholic or not) and great conversation.

This time, we asked **YOU** what it should be called. The responses were great, but the clear winner was "fooBarNight();", so well done to Andrew Young and Chase Hellemans who suggested it.
