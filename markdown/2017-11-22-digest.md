Hey everyone,

Nik is ill this week ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž so make sure to wish him well if you see him in
labs. Or avoid him. Up to you.

Firstly, if you are a Computing or JMC student, please make sure you are a member of your year's Facebook group, as
well as the main DoC group. We always try to include everything we do in these
digests, but sometimes, events and opportunities come up at short notice. We 
also run polls in these groups to help us decide event dates and the like.

Upcoming events:

# Weekly Capture The Flag Sessions

- **When:** Every Wednesday, 15:00-17:00
- **Where:** HXLY 308, Huxley Building

Just a reminder that we have weekly CTF sessions every Wednesday 3-5pm in Huxley 308.

By popular demand, this Wednesday (today) we will be focusing on web security. First, we will give a quick overview of computer networks and then make our way through progressively harder challenges (covering topics such as HTML forms, sanitisation vulnerabilities, and SQL injection). Bring your friends if you'd like, and as always, we would love an interactive format, so don't be shy!

We still have a few tickets available, but if you haven't already, make sure to be

WATCH THE TRAILER: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tq1C8spV_g>

On March 9, 2016, the worlds of Go and artificial intelligence collided in South
Korea. The best-of-five-game competition, coined The Deep Mind Challenge Match,
pitted a legendary Go master against an AI program that was still learning to
play the worldâ€™s most complex board game. AlphaGo chronicles a journey from the
backstreets of Bordeaux, past the coding terminals of Google DeepMind in London,
and, ultimately, to the seven-day tournament in Seoul. As the drama unfolds
before an audience of over 280 million viewers worldwide, more questions emerge:
What can artificial intelligence reveal about a 3000-year-old game? What will it
teach us about humanity?

Directed by Greg Kohs with an original score by Academy Award nominee, Hauschka.

# Talk on Health and AI

- **When:** 23rd November 2017, 18.30â€“20.00
- **Where:** HXLY 130, Huxley Building

Both speakers will be showcasing some very interesting tech demos as they discuss how AI 
promises to change the face of health, and how this will affect society.

# Want to help organise IC Hack 2018?

IC Hack is the UK's largest student-run hackathon. And DoCSoc organises it! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ As you can imagine,
this means that it takes an awful lot of work to make an event of this scale happen. If you want
to get involved and help to organise it, drop us an email or message through the Facebook page.

What we're looking for is people to take on some responsibility and ownership of aspects of the event
like branding, sponsorship and finance, event logistics and catering. This will require commitment from now
until after IC Hack (27th-28th January 2018).

If you just want to volunteer your time immediately before, during or after the event to help to make it happen, that's great!
We'll be sending out more details about this closer to the event, but there's no need to express your interest for
this just yet.

**Why?**
It's *really* fun and few other roles offer a similar experience. It can also look nice on your CV
if you spin it well.

**First years:**
Although we'd certainly be very welcoming of help we get from freshers, we'd suggest that you simply
enjoy your first IC Hack experience this year and give back to the community in later years, especially
if it's your first IC Hack. **Why? Is it because you think freshers would be useless and incompetent?**
No. We just think that IC Hack a fantastic experience for attendees and we don't want you to miss out on it.

However, if you're still really keen on helping to organise it despite this, do get in touch with us!
