Hello, and welcome to another year at the Department of Computing!
<br>Regardless of whether you're a returning student or just started, this
(albeit rather sizeable) email contains incredibly useful information, so keep
on reading!

# What is DoCSoc?
DoCSoc is the Department of Computing Society at Imperial College London!

This year it is brought to you by:

- **President**: Maurice Yap
- **Vice President**: Thomas Bower
- **Treasurer**: Levente Kurusa
- **Secretary**: Nik Vangerow (that's me!)
- **Academic Events Coordinator**: Rachel Mekhtieva Lee
- **Industrial Events Coordinator**: Yoon Kim
- **Social Events Coordinator**: Diana Avram
- **Events Officers**: Alessandro Bonardi, Jack Pordi, Rohan Pritchard
- **Marketing Officer**: Inara Ramji
- **Webmaster**: Elliot Greenwood
- **Game Dev Officer**: Uno Perwironegoro

Throughout the year you will also get to know your departmental representatives
(Dep Reps). They represent the student body (you) to the department.

This year they are:

- **Computing**: Martin Zlocha&nbsp;&nbsp;
  ([Email](mailto:dep-rep@doc.ic.ac.uk))
- **Joint Maths and Computing (JMC)**: Rachel Mekhtieva Lee&nbsp;&nbsp;
  ([Email](mailto:dep-rep@doc.ic.ac.uk))
- **Electronics and Information Engineering (EIE)**: Mwanakombo
  Hussein&nbsp;&nbsp;
  ([Email](mailto:mwanakombo.hussein15@imperial.ac.uk))

For details on how to get involved, just get in touch with us. We're always
looking for volunteers to help us set up and tear down the events. If you would
like to volunteer, please join our [DoCSoc: Operations Facebook
group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1509850436007222/).

## What Do We Do?
DoCSoc is run by students, for students. With the generous support of our
sponsors, we run events such as theatre trips, talks, and our infamous bar
nights (psst, all drinks are on DoCSoc)! Our membership base is mostly comprised
of Computing, JMC, and EIE students, but membership can also be purchased on the
[union
website](https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/activities/a-to-z/computing) for
anyone not on a DoC course. Why not get your friends on other courses to become
members too?

To stay up-to-date on the events that DoCSoc runs, keep an eye out for the
weekly digest (you're reading it right now) which is baked and then delivered
fresh to your inbox every week! Additionally, liking our [Facebook
page](https://www.facebook.com/ICDocSoc/) will help you stay up to date on
everything going on with DoCSoc.

## Our Sponsors
Without the support of our generous sponsors, much of what we do and what makes
DoCSoc so special would not be possible! Sponsors host many of our talks and
will occasionally let you know of their great job opportunities.

Which brings me on to why DoCSoc gets sponsorship: It's important to realise
that our sponsors are looking to hire YOU! You get to build your career while we
get the money to run awesome social events. To kick things off, we will be
hosting our annual Sponsors' Exhibition on the 12th October from 14.00-17.30 in
the Great Hall (more details below).

## Our Main Events

### Bar Nights

Oh, bar nights&hellip; Arguably one of DoCSoc's most known type of event, bar nights
happen just about every month during term time. They're a great opportunity to
talk to your coursemates and make new friends! Upon arrival, a volunteer will
greet you and hand you tokens which can be redeemed for a vast array of drinks
(both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) behind the bar. Ran out of tokens? Depending
on the event, just ask a committee member to give you a few more tokens. We
don't bite!

### Board Game Nights

Whether you're a *Monopoly* person or a *Settlers of Catan* person, board game
nights are the perfect opportunity to get your nerd on and fight for victory
with free snacks and drinks all evening.

### Talks
Our talks usually happen in the evenings, just after lectures. If you attended a
talk around lunch time and didn't like it, you're most likely confusing the
department's ACI talks with our talks. At the end of a talk we usually hand out
pizza for everyone! Veggie options are of course available.

### IC Hack
We run a hackathon every year called IC Hack.

Check out the epicness of IC Hack 2017 on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQl8tLcxptY)!

Want to get participate? Want to help run IC Hack? Details will follow later this
term!
We encourage all freshers to participate in their first year. Hackathons are a
blast to attend and an amazing experience regardless of whether you've never
been to a hackathon before or attend a different one very week.

# BlackRock

## About BlackRock Technology

BlackRock combines the best of being a technology pioneer and financial leader.
Since our inception in 1988, we've grown from an entrepreneurial start-up into
the world's largest investment manager by putting technology - and continuous
innovation - at the heart of our business.

We've invented our own global enterprise investment system, 'Aladdin': a
technology ecosystem that empowers our colleagues to do better business every
day. It is an unmatched operating platform - and central nervous system - that
unites all the information, people and technology needed to manage money in real
time and at every step in the investment process.

Unlike other financial firms, software engineering at BlackRock is a profit
centre, not a support function, and stands on its own as a fast-growing
business. Developers work in teams focused on specific components of Aladdin and
use innovative new technologies to build solutions for BlackRock and many
Aladdin clients.

  </div>
</center>

*Susquehanna are now sponsors of the Computing Society!*

Game theory rings true in everything we do. We're big on competition, strategy,
and managing risk &ndash; just like great gamers. We are problem solvers who
analyse the financial markets to identify profitable trading opportunities.

SIG is one of the largest privately-held financial institutions in the world. We
have offices all around the globe and trade an extensive range of financial
products. Building virtually all of our own trading technology from scratch, we
are a leading and innovative company in high-performance, low latency trading.

**Opportunities:** Our trading internship is a 10-week summer programme,
designed to expose you to the working environment that you can expect if you
return to SIG as a full-time Assistant Trader. The internship programme is our
primary hiring source for full-time trading positions at SIG.

You will learn what it's like to work in a trading environment through a
combination of SIG's classroom education and impactful work on our trading
desks. You will participate in daily classes with senior traders. You will learn
about options, poker, game theory and play mock trading games to help you
interpret the uncertainty in the markets and develop a rigorous analytical
approach to your decision making.

Education is the cornerstone to our success. We invest heavily in our interns
and graduates and our education programme is widely considered to be one of the
best in the industry.

Each intern will work on a specific trading desk. You will be assigned projects
to help your desk tackle unsolved problems. Projects can be related to analysing
trade data, improving efficiency, or creating new tools for the traders. In the
process, you will expand your knowledge of the products we trade and the
technology we use. Most importantly, you will spend significant time working
directly with our traders, learning how they make decisions and assess risk.

Upon completion of the internship you may be offered a returning role as an
Assistant Trader where you will become responsible for making independent
trading decisions.

**Apply online at:** <www.sig.com/campus-programmes> from 1st September 2017 -
8th December 2017<br>
**Contact:** <dubcampusrecruit@sig.com><br>
**This role is based in Dublin, Ireland.**

**Susquehanna will be attending the Imperial Finance & Consulting Careers Fair
on Thursday 5th October and the Engineering Careers Fair on Thursday 19th
October. Please join us for drinks at FiveSixEight, Beit Quadrangle, London SW7
2BB, UK on Thursday 19th October**

help others gain experience in programming. If you're planning to apply for
internships soon (or are already), contributing to open source projects can look
great on your CV.

Some of the current projects include:

  automatically assign first years to older students
- DoCSoc Sponsorship Portal which will allow you to upload your CV and apply to
  our sponsors for internships
