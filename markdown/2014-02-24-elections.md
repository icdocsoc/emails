# How do I Run?

- Read the position descriptions below
- Visit [https://vote.union.ic.ac.uk](https://vote.union.ic.ac.uk/login.php).
- Put yourself forward for a position
- Add a seconder
- DONE

The voting will happen after Sunday and you're also welcome to campaign, but that's definitely optional ([I did](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/iby78245kcuhe63/Dnk5MFn4AM) because it was fun and let me practice my haskell).

**It's dangerous to go alone, take this!** - by **this**, we mean a seconder, but that didn't fit the meme very well. Find a friend who thinks you might do a good job and when asked

# What are the Positions?

**President - The person who gets all the emails**

Oversee the running of the society. You'll liase with your committee, DepReps, other societies and the department itself to plan out exactly how DoC and DoCSoc are going to transcend to an even higher level of awesome. You get to help decide the direction the society goes in but the buck stops with you and it's your job to step in and help out with any tricky decisions or last minute emergencies.
*(Pete - Probably best suited to a third year who knows the ropes but doesn't have final year hanging over them...)*

**Events Officer x2 - The party animal with a serious side**

Help organise the next bar night, industry networking event, university mixer, workshop talk or any one of the awesome events we've done this year. There's typically one person who organises the industry events and one who organises the socials but that's just for convenience and you'll very closely on everything. The student experience is highly dependent on you, making sure they are kept involved in all events from a boozy bar nights to network + pizza evenings. Please note however, this isn't just a social position, you'll spend a lot of time booking rooms, making posters and navigating union red tape.

**Secretary - A little bit of OCD isn't a bad thing**

You'll be involved in all aspects of the society from sponsorship to events, making sure everything is ship shape and weekly digest emails are sent on time and with a suitable degree of humour. This is a real all rounder role and fantastic way to become more involved in department goings-on.

**Treasurer - Spreadsheets rock. SERIOUSLY**

DoCSoc has a very good track record of obtaining a lot of industry funding. Help us put it to good use and ensure we can continue to fund things which improve computing students lives. You'll be responsible for making sure claims go through and that we're categorising everything correctly. If you love spreadsheets, you're gonna love this.

You'll take the lead on our Facebook and Twitter accounts, keep the website in good condition and support the rest of the committee in making sure their latest event or venture is plastered over all four corners of the internet. You'll likely be working closely with the Project Officer and events officers to ensure our department is letting the rest of the world know just how damn awesome we are.
This year Alice also did a lot of work on making the sexy posters you've seen around labs.

Your role will be to oversee the various student led projects in the DoC. Examples from this and previous years include fancy timetables, CATE rewrites, Notification systems, new websites, hackathon registration pages and a lot of exciting future projects are no doubt also lurking in DoC. You'll work to organise continued community development and support of these projects.

**GameDev Officer - Basically a president all of their own...**
 
DoC has made a great start in game development the past two years with a regular group meeting up to discuss projects and programming relating to all things gamedev. We have a large amount of equipment - android, iOS, PS3, XBox + Kinect and we want to see what our students can do with it. You'll liase with the rest of the committee to help organise gamedev related events and ensure we're giving you everything you need to create something awesome!

# I'm not sure I'm qualified...

You are. Seriously, it's all volunteers and most of the committee had never been involved before this year.

My committee have been **AWESOME**; it's been a great year so far (and we're not even done yet!).

The events have been bigger than ever before, we've attempted new projects, streamlined DoCSoc processes (facebook pages, websites, student digests, administration etc) and we're even on track to get [Hoodies](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1pYZ70My21Vnlck5UnmarVwgSvr8pW70KviS7D0Zyw4I/viewform) organised, a feat which has managed to elude DoCSoc for the previous 4+ years.

If you have any questions about the elections or what the positions are like, feel free to email me at [docsoc@imperial.ac.uk](docsoc@imperial.ac.uk) or get in touch with a committee member directly.
