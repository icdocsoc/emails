Tonight we are hosting Skyscanner for a unique talk about experimentation and how you can use it to grow your product or company for the better. If you're interested, come along to Huxley 308 at 6:30pm - there will be free pizza! That's not all we've got going on this week though - we have several events running from our Bar Night this Thursday (finally!) to our UROP talk on Monday. So carry on reading to find out more...

# Experimentation at Skyscanner

* **Where:** Huxley 308
* **When:** **<span style="color:red">TONIGHT!</span>** 24th January 2017 6:30-8pm
* **Facebook:** [Click here](https://www.facebook.com/events/382075402144411/)

The value of experimentation is well known, and yet the implementation and scaling of experimentation from niche to pervasive is frequently a stumbling block and an area that business of all sizes struggle in. Colin McFarland, Head of Experimentation at Skyscanner, led the global travel search business from small-scale experimentation to a state where experimentation is an ingrained practice, with hundreds of experiments undertaken a month, in just over a year.

This talk will give practical steering in how to augment experimentation within a business, looking at the case for causality, common pitfalls to avoid, the importance of building tooling and education, and driving the data-focussed culture that is so essential in delivering a competitive edge.

**As always, pizza and drinks will be provided. Find out more information on the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/382075402144411/).**

It's time for the first Bar Night of 2017! Once again, we'll be meeting in the Union Bar at 7pm for an evening of free drinks (alcoholic or not) and great conversation. Hope to see you all there!

This time, we asked **YOU** what we should name our bar night. The responses were great, but the clear winner was "fooBarNight();", so well done to Andrew Young and Chase Hellemans who suggested it.
