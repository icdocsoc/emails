# Updates from DocSoc

## Career Fair

Yesterday, we held the first ever DocSoc Career Fair. 
Years ago organising a similar event would have been unthinkable. During the past two years, the growth of our society
has been incredible. The event was extremely successful and we would really like to thank everyone
who came by and talked to our sponsors.
If you still haven't sent any application yet, we highly encourage to do it ASAP.
You will find all the information you need in our [Internal Careers Portal](http://internal.docsoc.co.uk).

## Cancelled event: Internship 101

We are sadly to announce that we canceled the Internship 101 on Monday as it
is Graduation Day.
Keep an eye on the DocSoc digest though, we are planning on organising it soon.


## Do you that..

- **We do have an official Facebook group open to every year?**
Feel free to [join it](https://www.facebook.com/groups/119795004749465/)

- **We are a society run just by students?**
At the end of every year we hold elections to form the DocSoc committee.
However, we are always looking for more volounteers. If you would be happy to
help us, please send us an email at docsoc@imperial.ac.uk.
