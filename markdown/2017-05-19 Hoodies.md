Hey there! You are being emailed because you purchased either a **DoCSoc hoodie** or a **JMC hoodie** back in March. The good news is that these have now arrived and are available for pickup!

To collect yours, drop by labs **tomorrow (Saturday 20th May) between 12pm and 7pm**, and look for a [DoCSoc committee member](https://docsoc.co.uk/about) (we shouldn't be hard to find!). The Bar Night begins at 7pm tomorrow too, so you might want to collect yours before heading over to the Union Bar.

Don't worry if you can't make it tomorrow, we'll be arranging one or two more collection times before the term is up (and if you are on a placement, we'll hold on to yours for you!).

Thanks,

Tom & Alessandro
