# About the role: Software Engineering 6 Month Industrial Placement at Jump Labs USA

Jump Labs is located on the University of Illinois’s (UIUC) Research Park in Champaign, Illinois.
 
As a software engineering intern during your industrial placement, you will have the opportunity to help us build a sophisticated Bitcoin trading platform from the ground up, while receiving guidance and mentorship from engineers who build Jump Trading’s high-performance infrastructure for trading on financial exchanges around the world.
 
Our Bitcoin development team has the feel of a startup. It is small and flexible, so you will have the chance to make a big impact and to contribute to decisions about tools and technologies that will be used to build the system.
 
You will learn fundamentals of robust infrastructure design; sharpen your C++ programming skills; and contribute code to critical technology areas such as connecting to exchanges, managing order traffic, processing large streaming data, and tracking our positions in the market for calculating P&L and risk.
 
Our internship program is also the primary way we identify top young talent for our technology teams at Jump Trading. Excelling in this position at Jump Labs is a pathway to earning future internships and full-time positions with Jump Trading.
 
**QUALIFICATIONS / REQUIREMENTS**

Any degree discipline

- Experience with C++ programming on Linux
- Strong understanding of data structures and threading models
- Ability to work with a team in a fast-paced environment, deploying new software daily
