# DoCSoc Software Foundation

DoCSoc SF is looking for contributors! In July we started a new initiative which
aims to give you the tools and support needed to contribute to Open Source, we
call this the DoCSoc Software Foundation (DoCSoc SF). This is a great
opportunity to help build tools which will be used by students next year and
help others gain experience in programming. If you're planning to apply for
internships soon (or are already), contributing to open source projects can look
great on your CV.

Some of the current projects include:

- Mums and Dads (MaD) portal which will be used this year to sign up and automatically assign first years to older students
- DoCSoc Sponsorship Portal which will allow you to upload your CV and apply to our sponsors for internships
- Lab Climate for tracking the weather conditions in labs (How hot is labs v2)

If this is something you would be interested in then join slack on
<https://docsocsf.slack.com> and look at our [new
website](https://sf.docsoc.co.uk).
