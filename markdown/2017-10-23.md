Why should learning stop when you leave university? How can you can develop
as a coder who leads? At Next Jump we call this becoming a 10X Engineer,
which means developing software engineers who can not only build amazing
products used by millions of people, but can lead global product teams of
diverse backgrounds and skills.

Hear software engineer James Hughes' story and how he grew to become a
product lead in the UK just 1 year after graduation, helped develop coding
curriculums for school children and gave talks to industry leaders to improve
their company cultures, including Apple and the Ministry of Defense. In his
talk, he will draw upon lessons he has learnt and helping you all to become
10X engineers.
