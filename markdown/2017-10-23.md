Hi all,

Welcome back to yet another busy week full of events and coursework!

Consistent with previous weeks, this week we bring you a whole _two_ events.
First a workshop run by Next Jump tomorrow (Tuesday), and a G-Research coding
challenge on Thursday. Also look forward to our first academic reading group
which will be held next week.

Last week's Welcome Bar Night was well attended, with 320 people in total. We
hope you enjoyed the night! The Netcraft event also saw an impressive turnout
of roughly 160 people. 

Now, without further ado&hellip;

Why should learning stop when you leave university? How can you can develop
as a coder who leads? At Next Jump we call this becoming a 10X Engineer,
which means developing software engineers who can not only build amazing
products used by millions of people, but can lead global product teams of
diverse backgrounds and skills.

Hear software engineer James Hughes' story and how he grew to become a
product lead in the UK just 1 year after graduation, helped develop coding
curriculums for school children and gave talks to industry leaders to improve
their company cultures, including Apple and the Ministry of Defense. In his
talk, he will draw upon lessons he has learnt and helping you all to become
10X engineers.
