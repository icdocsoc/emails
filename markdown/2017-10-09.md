Hello,
 
My name is Pranav Malhotra and I have just graduated from Imperial College
and have joined Bank of America Merrill Lynch as a Technology Analyst. This
year, Bank of America Merrill Lynch is working with DoCSoc to invite you to a
host of exciting events that we have lined up. Come and meet recent graduates
like myself as well as experienced developers, architects and team leads at
the various events that we are holding on campus as well as at our offices.
 
I would like to take this opportunity to briefly share some of my own
experiences as an intern and now as a graduate. I find working at Bank of
America Merrill Lynch to be an incredibly rewarding experience because I am
always made to feel like a quintessential member of the team. My opinions and
insights are valued and I am constantly encouraged to question processes.
Graduates also have the opportunity to work alongside and learn from some of
the best developers in the industry.
 
At the bank, there is a very large focus on personal development. Last week,
we had a presentation by Trisha Gee, a developer advocate at JetBrains. She
provided great insight into how to perform an effective code review. As a
technologist, I value the opportunity to hone my own skills. I particularly
enjoy the nature of the work. There is great emphasis placed on the
performance and robustness of code that is released to production
environment. In the three months that I have been an analyst, I have learnt
so much about the Java Virtual Machine and am now confident in using a wide
array of design patterns to solve complex problems.
To learn more about Bank of America Merrill Lynch come and join us at the
following events:

1. DoCSoc Sponsors' exhibition: 12 Oct 2017 14:00 - 18:00hrs 
2. Bank of America Merrill Lynch firm-wide networking event: 25 Oct 2017
18:00 - 20:00hrs
3. Imperial College IT & Technology Careers Fair: 09 Nov 2017 17:00 -
19:30hrs

This year, we would also like to invite motivated students to a bespoke event
held at Bank of America Merrill Lynch's offices. Details will be
available shortly.
 
Applications for 2018 technology internship and graduate programmes are now
open. Please visit <https://campus.bankofamerica.com/> to file an
application.
 
Thanks so much and we hope to see you soon.
 
Best Regards,
Pranav Malhotra

Nominations in the Union Autumn elections are **NOW OPEN** and close at
**Midnight on Thursday, 12 October**!

It is an opportunity to make your voice heard within the College and the Union.

Every year students vote for at least one Academic Year Representative who
will receive and collate feedback from their cohort and will pass this
information to the Departmental Representatives or staff as appropriate.
Academic Representatives have made long-lasting improvements in many areas
such as the content of curricula, feedback quality and timeliness, exam
timetables and formats, online learning resources, and the physical
facilities available.
 
This year the Union has also newly launched a Wellbeing Representation
Network, which aims to tackle issues such as stress and pressure, mental
health, the quality of personal tutoring, how students are supported to be
resilient and independent, transitioning back into study after time off, and
more. Wellbeing Representatives will work with College staff, Welfare
Officers, and Academic Representatives.

To nominate yourself and for more information on the mentioned and other
roles available, [visit the Union's Autumn Elections
