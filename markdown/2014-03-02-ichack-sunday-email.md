# Important Information

Hi there!

You've signed up to receive information about IC HACK '14 - good choice! This email will give you more details about the event and formal registration process so please do read it.

**Registration instructions are at the bottom, don't miss them! You will need to fill out the form to secure your spot.**

First of all, if you haven't yet, have a look at our FAQ at http://ichack.org

We have received an amazing reaction from you, **over 300 people signed up!** This is awesome, but it also means we'll have to be quite tight in regards to spaces.

We had a number of people asking us whether non-Imperial students can attend. If you are a non-Imperial student and want to come hack, follow the registration process and we will let you know whether we have a space for you. Everyone is welcome to attend the demos on Sunday though which will be a great way to see all the devices in action and meet some interesting people!

We will ask you whether you have already formed a team, for this please choose a team name and have everyone on the team fill it in on the form. This is just for us to get an estimate on how many teams and people without a team we have.

The places will generally be assigned on first-come-first-serve basis.
