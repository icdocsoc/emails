It's February already! Now that the craziness of IC Hack is over and we've all had some time to recover, we can recommence with the regular Weekly Digest schedule! If you went to IC Hack or are interested, we recently uploaded an album of all the pictures from the weekend [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1621365501213326.1073741829.532842050065682&type=1&l=6fc55a74f7), so take a look. Anyway, next week we've got some interesting events coming up (as well as some feedback which we desperately need!) so please do take a few minutes out of your day to read this email.
