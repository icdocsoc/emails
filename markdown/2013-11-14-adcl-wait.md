**Thanks to everyone who signed up. Our list is now full!**

We said we had limited slots, well, due to unprecedented demand we appear to have rocketed through not only our "Upper Esimates" but right on through to double Amazon's maximum capacity.

First-Come-First-Served is the only fair way of doing this, so for those who signed up in time, we'll be in touch nearer the event to confirm everything.

To those who didn't quite make it, be assured we'll keep you on our list and if anyone drops out, we'll continue allocating on a first come first served basis. Keep an eye on your emails!

We're keen to do more of these kind of events in future, so if you have any ideas of things you'd like to do, offices you'd like to visit or companies you'd like to hear from. Let us know at [docsoc@imperial.ac.uk](mailto: docsoc@imperial.ac.uk).
