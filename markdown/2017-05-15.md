After a studious six week break, the DoCSoc Weekly Digest is back! Although exams are still going on and I really should be revising like everyone else, there are some interesting events and opportunities taking place this week which deserve to be publicised. Not only are we hosting one of our classic **bar nights** at the end of this week just in time to celebrate the end of exams, but second years will be having an **end of exam celebration** on Friday too. In addition, our sponsor Entrepreneur First is looking for a student ambassador, and a few other bits and bobs - find out more by reading the rest of the email below!

# The 1st Computer Games & Picnic

* **Where:** Hyde Park
* **When:** 19th May, 12:30-2:00pm
* **Facebook:** [Click here](https://www.facebook.com/events/825351934283247/)

**SECOND YEARS:** We computing students are a breed of our own. We are the people of free t-shirts, fierce independence and abstractions of abstractions that no one will ever understand. Come on Friday at 11:30, we will also have survived what is probably the toughest part of our degree. 3 weeks of living in a library, shit food and stats curve balls.

In order to celebrate this monumental occasion, we will be hosting The 1st Computer Games in Hyde Park at 12:30. In around an hour and a half, Computing students attending will fight for the honourable title of Computer Games Victor.

* **Special Guest:** King of the Jury, Mark Wheelhouse
* *More Special Guests* TBA

DoCSoC will be providing **free drinks** (alcoholic or not), and snacks to all participants. Bringing a picnic of your own / food to share with fellow coursemates is strongly encouraged.

**For any questions, contact [Oliver Stenbom](https://www.facebook.com/ostenbom), and see you there!**

Did you purchase a DoCSoc or JMC hoodie last month on the Union website? If so, good news! We'll be distributing these on **SATURDAY** in labs. Come any time between 12pm and 7pm to collect yours. Don't worry if you can't make it on Saturday, we'll arrange a few more opportunities in the coming weeks.

# EF Student Partner Opportunity

We’re on the lookout for a Student Partner to help us change the way the most talented students think about their careers. At Entrepreneur First we specialise in supporting people to build technically defensible companies from scratch and we’re looking for ambitious Student Partners to help us inspire and engage the best student technologists to build a startup with EF. This is a great opportunity if you’re interested in tech startups and either see yourself founding one or working for one in the future.

# Mentality Mental Health Survey

A fellow society of ours, Mentality is carrying out a survey to find out how effective mental health support is at Imperial. They really need people to (anonymously) tell them about their experiences so that they can try to improve the support system and the atmosphere at Imperial in an appropriate way guided by the needs of students. It would be fantastic if you could spare a few minutes to help them out, and hopefully in the long run it will benefit you and your fellow students, too.

**Fill in the survey [here](https://imperial.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_03co6hnl1gflfSt?Q_).**

*P.S. Speaking of surveys, we haven't forgotten about our end of term survey from last month. The winner of the Nintendo Switch will be informed next week.*

Okay that just about wraps it up for this week. I sincerely hope the rest of your exams (or perhaps your placements or projects) go swimmingly, and hope to see you at some of the events we hold this term! Now, back to revision.
