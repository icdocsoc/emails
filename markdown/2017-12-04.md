Wikipedia says that in the Netherlands and Belgium it is typically consumed around the 5th and 6th December. Grab yourself some Speculaas for this week. 10/10 would recommend. Though you should probably not eat them in labs.")

Hi all,

First of all, good luck to everyone who is sitting their exams soon.

Thank you to everyone who attended our early screening of the AlphaGo movie last
week. The [photos from this event are now
available, check them
out](https://www.facebook.com/pg/ICDocSoc/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1966023443414195)!

This week we bring you our annual Christmas party, complete with Christmassy
food, mulled wine, hot chocolate, etc. That's happening tomorrow.

Also just so that you're aware, we'll have our fourth bar night of this term on
the 16th of December! It's still a bit off but you might want to change your
travel arrangements in order to attend, since it's on a Saturday.
