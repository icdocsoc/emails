If you'd like to attend, please [sign up](http://bit.ly/icadcltrip-signup) as Amazon will need to print security badges for you.

- Making your own way there: [map](map - http://bit.ly/icadcltrip-directions). Aim to be there for **7pm**.
- Leaving with us: We'll leave as a group college from the Huxley building around 6 - 6:15pm, and head to Amazon's offices by tube.

The evening will consist of (to name a few):
- Intro from the developers at Amazon
- Trip around some of the working spaces
- See some of the awesome projects Amazon are currently working on. Amazon are working with all the latest consoles and platforms and also work with retail and IMDB (think Big-Screen, TV, iOS, XBox One, PS4 and more)

Amazon are actively hiring from Imperial so if you want to get an insight into graduate and internship opportunities, this is one of the best chances you're going to get! Some of last year's interns (next year's full time employees!) will also be there to answer questions and talk about their experiences.

Any questions, shoot us an email at [docsoc@imperial.ac.uk](docsoc@imperial.ac.uk). See you there!
