They said it couldn't be done. They said it'd never happen.

They said things like "These events are great, but where are our hoodies?".

They said things like "Pete Hamilton is *almost* the best President ever...but where are the hoodies?"

They said things like "Why did we make Joel secretary anyway?".

**Well, now the moment you've all been waiting for has arrived...**

Yep, that's right - we're selling hoodies. They're charcoal grey, zip-up, American Apparel (comfy) and have our logo embroidered on one side. Â£20. Not bad, eh?

Buy as quickly as you can - we're going to try and put in an order at the start of the week!
