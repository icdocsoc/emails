Hi Everyone, 

For those who attended, we hope you all enjoyed the ADCL visit on Tuesday!

Both the committee and Amazon would love to hear your thoughts on the event, so if you could help us out, we've made a quick feedback survey. (It's a few multiple-choice questions with some extra optional things at the end!).

[Fill out the feedback form!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10QoPBrHxj6ajHyTFS4llR4DgrO9jYUZL64sBFoL2B-Q/viewform)

Our very own Tom Wilshere (ex Amazon intern and returning graduate) has written a [blog post](http://docsoc.co.uk/articles/2013-11-19-amazon-office-visit/) on the DoCSoc website from the night, with some more information, and some photos from the event.
