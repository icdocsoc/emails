Hi all,

Welcome to the last week of the first term! Perhaps you're feeling sad that it's
already over, or perhaps you're already on your way to some faraway warm place.
Either way, we hope that you have an enjoyable break and a happy new year!

There won't be a digest during the holidays, though we might send you some email
occasionally.

This term we ran many events: From our Bar Nights, to CodeCon, workshops by our
sponsors NetCraft, Palantir, and G-Research, as well as talks on the Linux
Command Line and by our sponsors Facebook and Next Jump. We also had a
couple of DoCSoc Breakfasts, an early screening of the AlphaGo movie, went ice
skating, and to the theatrical rendition of the Lion King. Not to forget that
we've yet to go to see the new Star Wars movie and that our Next Jump Christmas
Bar Night is happening on **Saturday**. _Fun fact: this term we spent roughly
£11.14 on every Bar Night attendee!_

This term was huge for DoCSoc, we're really looking forward to running many
more exciting events next year. With IC Hack 18's planning and sponsorship drive
in full swing, 2018 will be a very exciting year for DoCSoc.
