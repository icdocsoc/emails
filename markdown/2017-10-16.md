Welcome back to another week of DoCSoc events. This week we brought you a
**Netcraft Workshop** and will run our first Bar Night: the **Welcome Bar
Night**. More details below!

Last week we advertised an event run by one of our sponsors, J.P. Morgan.
It's important to point out that *we did not run this event*. We apologise
that J.P. Morgan did not communicate the location of the event as effectively
as they could've perhaps done.

Last week's annual Sponsors' Exhibition saw over 500 members meeting the 14
sponsors present, which is an amazing turnout. Thank you to everyone who
attended the event!

# Autumn Elections

<center>
<h3>**VOTING IS OPEN**. [Please vote](https://vote.union.ic.ac.uk/).</h3>
</center>

This is an opportunity to make your voice heard within the College and the
Union.

Every year students vote for at least one [Academic Year
Representative](https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/your-union/autumn-elections-2017/available-roles#Academic%20Representatives)
who will receive and collate feedback from their cohort and will pass this
information to the Departmental Representatives or staff as appropriate.
Academic Representatives have made long-lasting improvements in many areas
such as the content of curricula, feedback quality and timeliness, exam
timetables and formats, online learning resources, and the physical
facilities available.
 
This year the Union has also launched a [Wellbeing Representation
Network](https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/your-union/autumn-elections-2017/available-roles#Wellbeing%20Representative),
which aims to tackle issues such as stress and pressure, mental
health, the quality of personal tutoring, how students are supported to be
resilient and independent, transitioning back into study after time off, and
more. Wellbeing Representatives will work with College staff, Welfare
Officers, and Academic Representatives.

There are also candidates running to be a [Union Council Ordinary
Member](https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/your-union/autumn-elections-2017/available-roles#Council%20Ordinary%20Member),
a position that involves proposing and agreeing Imperial College Union's
policies on critical issues such as tuition fees, widening access, and the
environment.

You have until noon on Friday of this week to vote in the elections.

Vote on the [Union voting page](https://vote.union.ic.ac.uk/), or read [more about the election](https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/your-union/autumn-elections-2017).
