As most of you know, we're doing [ICHack](http://ichack.org) again this year and this time we're focussing on wearable computing!

Well, in preparation and to psych you guys up for what will be an awesome weekend, we've got a Google Glass Explorer on campus today showing off their Google Glass.

There are a few lecture shout-outs this morning and then **we'll be in labs at the round tables 10.00 - 11.00** (look for the bright orange T-Shirts). We'll be there to let you ogle some cool tech and answer any questions you might have about the event.
