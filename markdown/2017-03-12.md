A new week, and a new bunch of incredible events and opportunities for you! Firstly, let me say a huge congratulations to the new committee who were voted in on Friday, and huge thanks to the 52% of members who played their part in our democracy by voting! **The full results of the Leadership Elections 2017 can be found [here](https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/news/leadership-elections-2017-results-full)** (scroll to 'Computing' for DoCSoc).

Super-sized mobile apps: Getting the foundations right

An email client. An instant messenger. A real-time financial market data viewer and news reader. A portfolio viewer. A note taker, file manager, media viewer, flight planner, restaurant finder..... All built into one secure mobile application. On 3 different mobile operating systems. Does this sound challenging?

Mark Olleson from Bloomberg's Mobile team discusses how conventional development tools and techniques scale poorly when faced with this challenge, and how Bloomberg tackles the problem.

**Food and drink will be provided as usual!** ***(Do we even need to say this anymore?)***

*DoCSoc Secretary*

(p.s. nobody ran for DoCSoc Secretary?! If someone wants to try living up to my Digest emails, look out for byelections next term where we'll try to find a replacement. Game Dev officer is also in need of a candidate)
