Entrepreneur First is the only seed investment programme in the world that selects entirely on the basis of talent. We recruit only the top tech students and recent graduates, often pre-team and pre-idea, and support them to build high-growth tech startups in London.

Come and hear Oli and David, two Imperial alumni who worked on several AI projects during their time at Imperial. Since graduating, they have been using their machine learning and coding knowledge to tackle real-world problems. Their team is developing an algorithm that performs audio segmentation and recognition, currently testing it on bird song recordings. They are now on the Entrepreneur First programme, which is supporting them to accelerate this idea into a high-growth startup.
