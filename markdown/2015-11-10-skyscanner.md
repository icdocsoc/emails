# Mental Health First Aid Lite Workshop

- **When**: Tuesday 15th December 4:30pm - 7:30pm
- **Where**: Meeting Rooms 1 & 2, Union Building

Computing is tough. Really tough. And quite often the course impacts the well-being of ourselves and our friends. Mental Health First Aid Lite is a course being run by the Union. The course aims to teach how to identify stigma, relate to other people's experiences, and how to look after your own mental well-being.

An *extremely* worthwhile course, being run for the second time. The costs are being subsidised by the union, and DoCSoc will reimburse the remaining cost making it **free** for any computing students. 

Please see [this link](https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/whats-on/event/2613) for more info. 

There are *very* limited places so please sign up only if you can make it.

# End of Term Bar Night!

- **When**: Saturday 19th December 7pm

# Search for a Student Blogger

Do you ever feel restrained by the language restrictions of programming? Want to try your hand at some creative writing, where you can express what you want, however you want and only worry about errors of the spelling kind? Want to be responsible for showing the world that computing students **DO** go out and **CAN** have fun? 

The truth is, our [blog](http://docsoc.co.uk/blog/) has been neglected... And we need **you** to bring it back to life. 

If you would be interested in coordinating the blog, or even just writing a single blog, please contact docsoc@ic.ac.uk as soon as possible!

*Hope we didn't overexcite and/or distract you from any important work. See you all at the awesome Skyscanner talk!*
