**Spaces are limited - get signed up fast!**

It's back! One of DoCSoc's most popular industry events is our trip to the Amazon Development Centre, and this year will probably be no exception.

(If you didn't get the hint, that's *another* push to get signed up quickly. Avoid disappointment!)

There will be demos, showcases, an office tour, networking and, of *course*, pizza and beer. Amazon have some really cool projects, working with all the latest consoles and platforms, and also work with retail and IMDB. TV, iOS, Xbox One, PS4...it's all there.

Amazon are also actively hiring from Imperial, so this will be a great opportunity to get some insight into graduate and internship openings. Networking is always useful. 

If you'd like to attend, please [sign up](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ztUIRT7BIw-ShI2-DGjiH2bbgspXEN-9Dju846XrAHc/viewform), as Amazon need to print security badges.

You've a couple of options for getting there:
- Make your own way. Map above, aim to be there for **18:30**.
- Leave with us in a big group! We'll be leaving as a group from the Huxley foyer around **6pm**, and heading over via tube.

Any questions, please don't hesitate to get in contact, or post on the Facebook event. See you there!
