Hi all,

GResearch are running a coding challenge on Wednesday the 27th November! 

- **When**: 1pm, Tuesday 27th November
- **Where**: Huxley Room 217/218
- **Sign Up**: [Online Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1E3DvBfPyR8qDLGaUJJLYzR8rxkaL9CmDWLl5PMrPPhw/viewform)

**Spaces are limited to 45, so sign up fast!**

**There won't be machines provided so please bring your own laptop.**

Test your coding skills trading fake money and win real prizes. G-Research has developed a simulated stock exchange where you can trade your strategies in competition with other teams. Whose will make the most money by the end of the session?

You'll be split into teams, given a brief overview of the system and then have 60 minutes to write your code (in C# - syntax help available) to trade on our simulated exchange. After that development time, your code will run in competition with the other teams and the team which makes the most money will win a Â£20 Amazon gift voucher for each member.
