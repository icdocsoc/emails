Please join us for dinner and a presentation on Signac, a startup funded by Palantir
 Technologies and Credit Suisse. We will discuss: 

* Why Palantir and CS decided to launch Signac as new company
* How Signac is using technology and data to stop employee fraud and reduce operational risk at banks
* What it is like working at our startup
* Members of the Signac engineering, HR, and corporate teams will be there to answer your questions.

### More about Signac:

Major financial institutions are integral to the stability of our economy and our society. But many of the world's most influential banks are old institutions with legacy IT systems and mountains of underutilized data. As a result, they struggle to measure and identify risk, which is problematic for everyone because of their power and function in today's global economy. 

Signac works with financial institutions to detect fraud and reduce risk to make our financial system safer. We deliver powerful software and innovative programs to help banks catch unauthorized trading and other fraudulent activity, while taking proactive steps to reduce their overall operational risk. You can learn more about us at [www.signac.net](http://signac.net).

**Tomorrow's event will also be attended by Signac CIO, Sean Hunter.**

Sean Hunter is Signac’s Chief Information Officer. Prior to founding Signac, he worked as a Forward Deployed Engineer at Palantir Technologies where he led trader oversight partnerships with large financial institutions, including Palantir’s work with Credit Suisse. Before Palantir, Sean was a strategist in the securities division at Goldman Sachs. Over a period of 8 years he worked on various desks including equity exotics and hybrids, mortgages and algorithmic trading. Prior to GS he was IT director at a dot-com startup, writing their initial systems and managing a growing development team through two IPOs. Sean used programming to fund a postgrad in Jazz and used to be a professional bass player.

# Bloomberg Tech Talk

* **When:** 29th November 2016, 5:30pm
* **Where:** City Gate House, 39-45 Finsbury Square, Bloomberg LP, London, EC1A 2PQ
* **Tickets:** [Click here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/tech-talk-and-trading-game-at-bloombergs-london-hq-tickets-29523988043) (Free!)

### Tech Talk: Data Mining usage patterns for building the right thing, building the thing right and supporting the thing better!

This talk will cover how Data Analysis and Machine Learning from usage patterns across large data sets is being used to predict bug reports, improve automated testing, and make tough decisions on what features to add to our software. We realised that data gathered for regulatory audit purposes, on millions of daily trades at Bloomberg, is an invaluable resource for analysis of our system's behaviour. 

In this talk, we'll share the various opportunities this data has uncovered, the techniques we used for statistical analysis-based machine learning, and the data visualization behind it. The work we're planning and discoveries we've made promise to answer some very hard questions around prioritizing features to implement, reducing support costs, improving the automated test coverage and beyond. This also spawned an automated testing framework that allows the system to self-test by replicating the millions of daily trades in a secure test environment to achieve quality assurance. This has opened up horizons to build autonomic systems in the future systems that can both self-test and self-repair.

# Equality in DoC

DoC's Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Committee are looking create some services which allow people to get support or give feedback on the department's approach to equality and diversity.

The current suggestions are having an anonymous web form, several email contact points, and/or a phone hotline.
It would be great if you guys could let me know which of these services you would prefer, or let me know a different approach which might be more useful.

If you'd like to get involved, message Jonathan Sutton on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/Jonny.Sutton1), or drop him an email (js7814@ic.ac.uk). He'll then pass on this feedback to the committee at the next meeting.
