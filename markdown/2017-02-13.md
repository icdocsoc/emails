Stay tuned for more information about that event. Also this week, we're supporting an interesting Entrepreneur First talk hosted by Effective Altruism, as well as our usual Web Dev workshop. In addition, some of our sponsors are still looking for interns, and we're still looking for feedback for our Microsoft event a few weeks ago. Take a read below for the full details!

# Why Deep Tech Startups are High Impact

Want to create a high-impact, deep tech startup?

*Effective Altruism (EA) Imperial* brings you a talk on:

* Why you should start a Startup, specifically the High Impact it can have on the world. 
* Matt's thoughts on the current tech landscape for Deep Tech startups.
* Q&A
* Chance to speak to EF's talent team

The event is supported by DocSoc. 

* **What's Effective Altruism?** Effective Altruism is a philosophy and social movement that applies evidence and reason to determining the most effective ways to improve the world.

* **Who's Matt Clifford?** Matt Clifford MBE is the co-founder and CEO of EF, www.joinef.com/, https://medium.com/@matthewclifford
  Matt co-founded EF after leaving his job as a consultant at McKinsey & Co. He is an alumnus of Cambridge and MIT, where he was a Kennedy Memorial scholar.


* **What's EF?** EF is the best place for Europe’s top technical individuals to meet and build world-changing startups in London. They select purely on the basis of technical talent, so you can apply before you have a team or an idea. The intensive 6-month programme is designed to give you the best possible support in the first 200 days of your startup’s life. **EF’s most successful startup, Magic Pony Technology, was started by two Imperial Alumni, Rob Bishop (EEE graduate) and Zehan Wang (JMC and PhD in Computer Vision). Magic Pony was bought by Twitter in 2016 for $150m. Many other EF alumni are Imperial graduates. We strongly recommend this event for those studying technical degrees and PhD students.**
