Hello and welcome to yet another DoCSoc Digest (and what could well be my last ever as my tenure as Secretary comes to a close). I hope everyone is enjoying themselves now that term is over, whether you're tanning on a beach somewhere or hard at work on an internship or placement. Anyway, some of our sponsors have sent over some fantastic opportunities for you to consider: Palantir is offering a brand new 'Women in Tech' scholarship which might be of interest to some of you, and EF is offering a unique scheme ideal for graduates who are aspiring founders, or who want to work in a startup or venture capital fund in the future. So grab a cup of tea and get reading the full details down below!

# [Entrepreneur First] The EF Graduate Scheme

<center>![](http://i.imgur.com/nyaesh4.png)</center>

The EF graduate scheme provides a unique opportunity for high performing graduates to start their career with the world's best company builder. This structured and supportive training programme will give you exposure to how EF builds companies, how our funds work and how we get the world’s best technologists to join us. You'll leave with a breadth of knowledge about startups and VC, alongside developing hard skills such as problem solving, communication and analytics.

This programme is ideal for graduates who are aspiring founders, or who want to work in a startup or venture capital fund in the future. 

It's going to be an intense, fast paced and steep learning curve, but if you are looking for a challenge and fast immersion into the UK startup ecosystem, there's no better place to start. You don’t need any prior startup, tech or VC knowledge and will be fully supported throughout your time at EF.

We are looking for 2-4 graduates who have a strong academic background, who are curious and hardworking.

**Deadline is Wednesday 12th July 2017. You need to be within 18 months of graduating to be eligible. Find out more and apply now [here](https://boards.greenhouse.io/workforef/jobs/728601#.WVln-9PyufR).**

We launched the **Palantir Women in Technology Scholarship** in 2010 to celebrate and support women who are beginning careers in technology. We hope to encourage women to pursue computer science, engineering, and technical studies, and become leaders in the field.

This year, 10 scholarship recipients will visit our office in London for a full-day workshop to learn about our work, see demos of our products, and meet Palantirians. All scholarship recipients are awarded grants of up to £10,000 to support their education, and select participants are offered a Palantir internship.

**Deadline is Friday 28th July 2017 at 11:59PM PST. Find out more and apply now [here](https://www.palantir.com/college/scholarship/wit-europe/).**
