Our upcoming events:

# Palantir Extreme Startup

- **When:** 16th November 2017, 18.30-20.30
- **Where:** RSM G01, Royal School of Mines
- **Link:** [Facebook](https://docsoc.co.uk/extreme-startup/) [Tickets (Eventbrite)](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/palantir-extreme-startup-tickets-39830884247)

Today's critical institutions don't just protect public safety or provide vital
goods and services—they also deal with astonishing amounts of data. At Palantir,
we build software that lets organizations integrate and analyze their data to
solve problems they couldn't before. For example, we're helping our customers
combat terrorism at home and abroad, investigate and prosecute financial fraud
rings, offer more credit to retail banking customers, manufacture products
faster and more safely, and fight violent crime in the world’s great cities. And
we're just getting started.

Very often, doing this efficiently requires quick iteration and adaptation to
customers' requirements, needs and resources. This can only be done effectively
with a platform that is designed for easy extension and configuration.

Come join us at our Extreme Startup event and test your engineering skills!
We'll work on a scenario that Palantir uses internally to train their software
engineers to develop clean, maintainable and adaptable code.

Food and drink will be provided at the event. Palantir will also be holding a
Bar Night afterwards: (see below)

WATCH THE TRAILER: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tq1C8spV_g>

On March 9, 2016, the worlds of Go and artificial intelligence collided in South
Korea. The best-of-five-game competition, coined The Deep Mind Challenge Match,
pitted a legendary Go master against an AI program that was still learning to
play the world’s most complex board game. AlphaGo chronicles a journey from the
backstreets of Bordeaux, past the coding terminals of Google DeepMind in London,
and, ultimately, to the seven-day tournament in Seoul. As the drama unfolds
before an audience of over 280 million viewers worldwide, more questions emerge:
What can artificial intelligence reveal about a 3000-year-old game? What will it
teach us about humanity?

Directed by Greg Kohs with an original score by Academy Award nominee, Hauschka.
