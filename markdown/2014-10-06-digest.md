<center>*Welcome to DoCSoc's weekly digest, your solution to Fresher's Flu and hangovers.*</center>

# Welcome!

Hello, and a very warm welcome to another wonderful year in the Department of Computing at Imperial! If you're new here, this email has lots of lovely information for you to shove into your grey matter. If you're *not* new, feel free to just read anyway. You might learn something, yeah?

Right.

**What is DoCSoc?**

'DoCSoc' is the Department of Computing society. Basically, it's our job to make sure you have a fun, productive and enjoyable time here at Imperial. We're here to look out for you. Like Batman.

**Okay - what exactly do you do?**

We exist to represent the student body within the department, and to give you the best social experience we can. We organise loads of really fun events throughout the year, like bar nights, football tournaments, gaming tournaments and hackathons. We also try and connect you up with the industry as best we can - we organise visits to offices, talks and competitions. Also, swag. Swag is important.

**Who are you?**

The DoCSoc Committee in all its wonderment are as follows:
* President: Yulia Bulgakova
* Secretary: Joel Auterson (That's me. The handsome, charming one who sends you emails.)
* Treasurer: Ashley Hemingway
* Events Officers: Andrea Michi and Alex Rozanski
* Industrial Liason - Lawrence Jones
* Webmaster: Nic Prettejohn
* Projects Officer: Ben Chin
* GameDev Society President: Bradley Pollard
* Dep-Rep: Robert Zhou
* JMC Dep-Rep: Brian Liu

**What's a 'digest'? Can I eat it?**

Sorry, emails aren't edible. The digest is *this* thing, in all its wonderment - you'll get one from me every week (in theory), with all the events and info you can shake a stick at. This means you won't get bombarded with an email for every single event. Cool, huh?

Hopefully that's all the info you'll need - if you've any questions, though, don't hesitate to contact one of us. We have Facebook and Twitter accounts too, if you're into that sort of thing - links are at the top of this email, check 'em out.

# Hoodies?

Okay. We need to talk about hoodies.

There's been an issue over the summer with the payment system for the Union. We placed the order for the hoodies a while back, but somehow the payment was 'missed' by the financial department at the Union - apparently there's been a problem with one of their systems.

Hoodies *are* coming - the payment should have now been processed - but unfortunately they're not here yet. Massive apologies for this on my part, but it is now out of my hands - hopefully there shouldn't be too much longer left to wait. Your patience is massively appreciated.

*-- Joel Auterson (DoCSoc Secretary)*

# DoC GameDev Society

Hey, listen!

GameDev Society is a sub-society of DoCSoc that aims to provide a place where you can find other enthusiastic game developers. It's a great place to learn how to make games, find partners for projects, and even discover a path into the games industry.

Last year we had a number of events, including industry talks from developers like EA, and in-college competitions with real prizes, like the first ever Imperial Game Jam.

If that sounds like your thing, we meet every Wednesday at 7pm in the back of labs, room 202, starting next week (the 15th). We'll be beginning with some tutorials to get everyone started, but if you have your own pet projects please bring them along to show off!

Lastly, make sure to join our Facebook group, where I will post events and updates: https://www.facebook.com/groups/DoCGameDev/
