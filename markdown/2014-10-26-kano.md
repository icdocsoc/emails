Hi all,

Yonatan is the CEO of Kano, a computer kit for people of all ages to build a computer from scratch and learn basic coding skills; easy as Lego, powered by Raspberry Pi!  

Founded in 2013, Kano has raised over $1.5million from Kickstarter alone, making it the most crowdfunded learning invention ever on the site with backers including Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak and Kickstarter CEO Yancey Strickler himself. The product has featured extensively worldwide in media publications including Wired, BBC, Guardian, Techcrunch, Bloomberg, CNBC and Fast Company. 

Yonatan will be discussing how he came up with the idea for the product, how he managed to gain funding and other topics related to general entrepreneurship as well as showcasing Kano and networking/taking questions at the end. 

Event will be open to everyone. Simply click attending on the Facebook event above.
