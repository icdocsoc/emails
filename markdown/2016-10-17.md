Freshers' Fortnight is over but there's never a shortage of things to do when you're a member of DoCSoc! Things are settling down, and we hope you aren't too bogged down with the assignments just yet!

This week we have a whole host of interesting, helpful, and social events for you to get stuck in to. From our bar night on Tuesday to our DoCSoc Operations talk, there's a lot going on so take some time out to read this email carefully!

We're also going to share some interesting blogposts this week. If you have any interesting blogs or websites you'd like to share with the rest of the department, feel free to shoot us an email at docsoc@imperial.ac.uk!

Okay, let's get started...

Following the tremendous success of our 2015 University Challenge, we are delighted to announce that we are hosting another event this year! This prestigious event gives you the opportunity to compete against the best universities across the UK and Ireland. Taking place between 20th – 21st October 2016 at our EMEAR HQ, we will invite five students from each of the top 15 universities throughout the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland.

From each university we will be seeking a team of five students to work on solutions related to emerging technologies within our increasingly digitized world. The problem statements will be derived from enterprise use-cases developed from daily challenges encountered by our customers and partners. Each task will give the teams an opportunity to develop a fresh and innovative approach to creating solutions in software.

This event will encourage and enable the students to work in a collaborative environment, that will give the teams real world experience in one of the world’s leading technology companies.

The challenge will be open to multiple degree types and will be targeted at first year students, students looking for a year in industry and final year students with graduation expected in either 2017 or 2018. This includes BA, BSc, MSc & PhD students. The winning university will receive prizes and trophies.

A team of x5 is required consisting of 3x Software Engineers, 1x Project Manager and 1x Business Analyst.

**Travel, accommodation and food costs will be covered by Cisco. **

# Food for Thought: Interesting Blogposts

In case you thought you were having a bad week getting back to university again or for the first time, [here](http://www.be9.io/2015/09/21/memory-leak/) is a person that spent two weeks debugging a memory leak in Ruby, it's definitely a worthwhile read on memory leaks and their debugging.

Cosmic rays happen. Soft errors happen. [This short post](http://www.mono-project.com/news/2016/09/12/arm64-icache/) explains a bug that would definitely look like as one. But it's not. Albeit it being low-level, we hope that it is someone people find interesting.

If you are a fresher, you may have been wondering how the hell can you just print out a text in Haskell? Well, [here](http://www.haskellforall.com/2013/01/introduction-to-haskell-io.html) is a nice introduction to I/O (Input/Output) that explains quite a bit without introducing the dreaded thing, the monad.

If you are eager for some computer history, [here](https://eev.ee/blog/2016/09/18/the-curious-case-of-the-switch-statement/ ) is a nice story about the statement we all love or hate, switch.

Did you know that there was an instruction in BASIC that's called COMEFROM? An opposite of GOTO. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMEFROM ).

It's that time of the year again when people are correcting their CVs, and applying to companies. If you are looking for something to pimp up your CV, contributing to open source is a great thing to do. [Here](https://hackernoon.com/benefits-of-contributing-to-open-source-2c97b6f529e9) is a blog post for you.
