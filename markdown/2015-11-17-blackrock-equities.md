# IC GameDev Society (Today!)

- **When**: TODAY at 7pm - 9pm
- **Where**: Back Labs

For people who are unaware, DoCSoc runs a game development meet up for like minded people to discuss everything from the latest news in game development to learning to create your own games! It's also a great place to find partners for projects, talk about games and even discover a path into the games industry. We also have lots of cool hardware including an Oculus Rift DK2, as well as a Leap Motion and some other hardware! We meet up **every Wednesday** 7-9pm *(including today!)*, and are currently planning on running a themed competition to span until the end of term, details to be discussed tonight. 

See you there!

# Star Wars Tickets (Last Chance to buy!)

As many of you may be aware, DoCSoc are attending the science museum IMAX cinema to see Star wars on the 19th December. 

Our *last* batch of tickets will go on sale **THIS FRIDAY** at **1:30pm** on [this website!](https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/shop/club-society-project-products/computing-products) 

We only have 50 tickets left. The first batch sold out in 11 minutes, the second batch sold out in 9 minutes, so you'd better be ready if you want a ticket for less than *half the price* of a regular ticket!

# Mental Health First Aid Lite Workshop

- **When**: Tuesday 15th December 4:30pm - 7:30pm
- **Where**: Meeting Rooms 1 & 2, Union Building

Computing is tough. Really tough. And quite often the course impacts the
well-being of ourselves and our friends. Mental Health First Aid Lite is a
course being run by the Union. The course aims to teach how to identify stigma,
relate to other people's experiences, and how to look after your own mental
well-being.

An *extremely* worthwhile course, being run for the second time. The costs are
being subsidised by the union, and DoCSoc will reimburse the remaining cost
making it **free** for any computing students.

Please see [this link](https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/whats-on/event/2613)
for more info.

There are *very* limited places so please sign up only if you can make it.

# End of Term Bar Night!

- **When**: Saturday 19th December 7pm

Nothing is better than a few drinks to celebrate the end of term!

Of course you can expect awesome deals for drinks - definitely free drinks for
current students! Location and number of **free** drinks, to be confirmed!

# (Still) Searching for a Student Blogger

Do you ever feel restrained by the language restrictions of programming? Want to
try your hand at some creative writing, where you can express what you want,
however you want and only worry about errors of the spelling kind? Want to be
responsible for showing the world that computing students **DO** go out and
**CAN** have fun?

The truth is, our [blog](http://docsoc.co.uk/blog/) has been neglected... And we
need **you** to bring it back to life.

If you would be interested in coordinating the blog, or even just writing a
single blog, please contact docsoc@ic.ac.uk as soon as possible!
