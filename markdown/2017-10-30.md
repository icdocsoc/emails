Hi all, 

The end of October is nearly upon us, and another week has begun. This week
we bring you a talk by Nic Prettejohn, former DoCSoc president and Forward
Deployed Engineer at Palantir! This talk is invaluable if you have little to
no experience of applying for software engineering roles and will focus
primarily on technical interviews. On Tuesday we're also running our first
Academic Reading group in Programming Languages Research. If this is
something that sounds interesting to you, find more details below!

Our upcoming events:

# Interview Skills by Nic Prettejohn

    ![Interview Skills by Nic Prettejohn Header](https://i.imgur.com/lbwFON1.png)

- **When:** **<font color="red">TODAY</font>** 18.15–19.15, 30th October 2017
- **Where:** Huxley 311
- **Link:** [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/817598251747192/)

The recruitment process for Software Engineers is very different to other
graduate roles. Much of the time generic advice just doesn't cut it and will
fall short of warning you about the unique challenges applicants face.

Aimed towards students with little to no experience of applying for software
engineering roles, this talk will cover how to prepare for and ace technical
interviews. Come along to find out more!

The talk will be given by Nic Prettejohn who graduated from Imperial with a
BEng in Computing in 2016 and was the former DoCSoc President. He now works
at Palantir as a Forward Deployed Engineer.

The speaker's views are their own. Talks are purely educational and are not
part of any sponsorship relationship with DoCSoc.

- **Where:** Imperial College Robotics Society, 506 EEE Building
- **Links:** [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/1410061225709920/) [Registration](https://foundersfactory.com/robot-restaurant-hackathon/)

**Sign up to ICRS FoodHack 2017!**

We are extremely excited to announce the first hackathon of the year, **ICRS
FoodHack 2017**: [Robot Restaurant
Hackathon](https://foundersfactory.com/robot-restaurant-hackathon/)! FoodHack
will take place on the **18th &amp; 19th of November 2017**.

We are co-hosting the Hackathon with [Founders
Factory](http://www.foundersfactory.com/), along with some great sponsors;
[Automata](https://getautomata.com/) and
[VitaMojo](https://www.vitamojo.com/#/index).
 
What's better than food or robots? Food AND robots of course! This event aims
to bring the exciting phenomenon of robotic restaurants to ICRS in a
competitive and fun format. During the Hackathon, participants will explore
in teams predefined problems within restaurants that have been defined by the
Founders Factory team during their own robotic restaurant project. Teams will
be given two days to come up with and build out solutions before presenting
them to a star studded panel of judges. The hackathon will provide great
opportunities to explore, network and learn, whilst also gaining exposure and
recognition from your peers, the Founders Factory team and other experts.
 
Let your friends know you're coming on the Facebook event
[here](https://www.facebook.com/events/1410061225709920/)! To find out more
