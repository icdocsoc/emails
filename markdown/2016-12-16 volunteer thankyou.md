From all of us here at DoCSoc, we would like to thank you sincerely for all of your contributions as a member of *DoCSoc Operations* this term.

The amazing events we've held this year - from our Sponsors' Mingle all the way back in Week 2 to our Winter Mixer a few weeks ago - were made possible, in part, by all of the hard work and countless hours you have put in to help.

We'd love for you to attend our final Bar Night of the term tomorrow, where you might be rewarded for your efforts this term ;).

Thanks once again, and we'd love to see you get involved next term too!

Have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
