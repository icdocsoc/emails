Netcraft is running a workshop where you can learn some of the opportunities
that exist to make catastrophic mistakes when developing and maintaining a
web application on the Internet.
 
Until recently staff at a big three global consumer credit agency worth $tens
of billions, joked that they were [one hack away from bankruptcy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-09-29/the-equifax-hack-has-all-the-hallmarks-of-state-sponsored-pros).
Attempting to fulfil the prophecy, within 24 hours of the announcement that
their credit scoring data on some 140 million people had been stolen, a
feeding frenzy of class action suit lawyers had commenced to [sue the crap out of Equifax](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/09/08/lawyers_line_up_to_sue_equifax/).
 
What sort of programming error can be that expensive? How much is it worth to
the lawyers? And how much is a mistake like that worth to the hacker who
finds it?
 
Your challenge is that you are looking at a credit agency's web interface
holding credit information on hundreds of millions of people. If you can find
a way to extract this data, it could sell for [$10-20 per person](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-15/equifax-hack-your-social-security-and-identity-are-for-sale).
After a short tutorial outlining and illustrating the concepts, you will
compete against your peers to exfiltrate as much consumer credit data as you
can.

To take part, bring your own laptop, equipped with a modern web browser and
[Burp](https://portswigger.net/burp/freedownload). Swotting up on common web
vulnerabilities and misconfigurations will improve your chances.

Netcraft staff (including many DocSoc alumni) will be available throughout to
help.

Pizza and drinks will be provided at the event. In order to give an accurate
idea how many staff Netcraft should bring and how much pizza we should buy,
please press 'Going' if you intend to come.
 
Netcraft's previous workshops have been [very popular](https://www.facebook.com/events/1498700670427466/).
 
There will a free bar at the Union Bar after the competition.
 
As always, you must be a member of DoCSoc in order to attend this event.
Computing, JMC and EIE students are automatically members.
