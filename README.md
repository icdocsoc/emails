# DoCSoc's Emails

Source files for every email we've sent out over the last few years.
Newer emails are composed in XML and are in the `xml` directory, older emails
are composed in Markdown and are in the `markdown` directory.

## Usage

The XML files can be processed into our email template using the
[mailgen](https://github.com/icdocsoc/mailgen) tool. This is the preferred
format for composing emails.

The Markdown files can be processed into our email template using the
[digest-emails](https://github.com/icdocsoc/digest-emails) tool.
